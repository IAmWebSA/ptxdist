2006-03-24 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* busybox: made vim an alias to vi; patch by Sascha Hauer
	* toplevel: added real autoconf support and some initial tests
	  for things already mentioned in the todo list
	* configdeps: improved configdep generation. Until now if you 
	  had menuconfig entries and a sub-entry selected another
	  packet, but the menuconfig itself was deselected, the
	  configdeps magic incorrectly activated the selected package.
	  Patch by Marc Kleine-Budde.
	* xorg: fixed bug in x.org which broke CAN
	* initng: initial support for initng; patch by Erwin Rol
	* udhcp: fixed; patch by Erwin Rol
	* makefiles: re-activated project specific patches, which have
	  been broken in 0.10 until now. Patch by Sascha Hauer.
	* udev: update from 0.68 to 0.88. Erwin Rol.
	* Xaw: fixed dependency; patch by Erwin Rol.

	* release: released 0.10.2

2006-03-21 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* release: released 0.10.1

2006-03-20 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* overall: fixed various examples and configurations, updated to
	  use the 0.10.1 version all over the place
	* changelog: updated since 0.10.0
	* ptxdist: compilercheck reanimated
	* ptxdist: .ptxdistrc has now the version added, to avoid that
	  incompatible versions are clashing.
	* ptxdist: more checks for config files have been added
	* ptxdist: native build works now with --native
	* ptxdist: autobuild reanimated
	* config/: obsolete stuff removed
	* setup: default SF mirror changed

2006-03-19 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* ptxdist: reanimated 'ptxdist kernelconfig'
	* ptxdist: added 'ptxdist maintainer configversionbump'
	* ptxdist: clone with tar and svn exclusion instead of cp
	* gdb: fixed: source for cross-gdb was not fetched correctly. 
	  The gdb version was updated to 6.4. 

2006-03-14 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* libezV24: added
	* toplevel: debian packetized

2006-03-12 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* toolchains: fixed cross gdb paths to install into the same
	  directory as the crosstool components.

	* ptxdist clone: fixed; thanks to Erwin Rol for the bug report

2006-03-11 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* autobuild: The statistics functions have been moved to
	  ptxdist, so the autobuild scripts do only contain the 
	  call to the build process now. 

	* ptxdistrc: $HOME/.ptxdistrc is now versioned, to avoid that
	  people use old and incompatible ones. 

	* ptxdistrc: We have a user configurable src directory again, 
	  in .ptxdistrc.${FULLVERSION}. 

	* projects: separated toolchains and example projects. 

2006-03-10 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* ptxdist: integrated autobuilder in ptxdist

	* toolchains: fixed chicken-egg-problem while building
	  toolchains

	* ipkg: fixed ipkg build mechanism and image creation.

2006-03-09 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de

	* release: released 0.10.0. 

	There are too many features added & cleaned up in the 0.10.0
	release than could be mentioned here. This release is basically
	the last step before an 1.0 series; all functionality has been
	moved to the 'ptxdist' frontend command now, so there is no need
	to call 'make' directly any more.

	PTXdist can now be installed, which means that the standard
	configure && make && make install mechanics works, although the
	configure script is no "real" autoconf script yet. We plan to
	provide one. Several PTXdist versions can be installed in
	parallel now and it should be packageble for distributions.

	One serious bug in the release was already found, the toolchains
	test for the crosscompiler version (chicken-and-egg). Expect a
	0.10.1 release anytime soon, probably before you read this ;)

	All project work is now done in a user- and project centric way.
	You work on your project's "workspace" directory (equivalent to 
	the out-of-tree directory in 0.9). 

	Packet management has been much more streamlined. You always
	need a .make _and_ .in file for each packet and packet names
	must have a strong relation to their kconfig labels, like this: 

		project-foo -> PROJECT_FOO

	All "included" projects have been migrated to the new formats,
	but not all of them have been tested extensively. Expect more
	releases in the near future which restore the old auditing
	mechanisms. 

2006-02-03 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* trunk: opened 0.10 trunk. 

	The even/odd version number scheme turned out to be too unflexible; it
	is impossible to tell people that, once they have reached a stable
	state, they still have to switch to a new version line. So the new
	policy is that the latest minor version number is the current
	development series (0.10 from now on) and all earlier series are in bug
	fix mode only. Nevertheless, there may be occasional releases of these
	series when the projects require it.

	The autogenerated dependencies introduced in 0.9 have turned out to be
	working fairly well, it's just a little bit annoying that the creation 
	is triggered too often and takes too much time on slow machines. So 
	the main goal for the 0.10 series is to write a PTXdist wrapper script 
	which does what you did with 'make <action>' before, like 
	'ptxdist <action'.  This gives us more possibilities (think of 
	'ptxdist copy <existing_project> <new_project>') without adding more 
	ifdef hell to the toplevel makefile. In fact, one of the reasons for 
	doing this is to cleanup the toplevel makefile which has growin
	into a shell script triggering machine over the time. Additionally, the
	projectdir layout will improve over the 0.10 series, to make it
	easier to do real customer project work with PTXdist.

2006-01-31 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* genext2fs: update to 1.4rc1 which doesn't need the patches any
	  more (patch by Randall Loomis)
	* openssh: fix autogenerated dependency (patch by Ladislav
	  Michl)
	* release: 0.9.1 released

2006-01-30 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* mico: added support for MICO. 

2006-01-26 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: this is a technology preview of the upcoming 0.9
	  series of PTXdist. Not everything is working right now,
	  but we have autogenerated dependencies.

2006-01-03 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: merged destdir branch into 0.9-trunk
	  kernel: replaced DONT_COMPILE_KERNEL by 
	  COMPILE_KERNEL

2005-12-28 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* trunk: migrated destdir branch to new 0.9 trunk
	  The tree is now using destdir/sysroot as it's standard
	  mechanism. It doesn't work in all places, but it's the
	  way to go for the future. 

2005-12-20 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* Rules: remove some bogus mkdir $(IMAGEDIR)s; 
	  Patch by Ladislav Michl

	* bash: fixed PATH; patch by Vince Chen

2005-12-14 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* release: released 0.7.8. This is just an intermediate
	  release. We are working hard towards 1.0, so expect
	  things to be completely broken. You have been warned.

2005-11-30 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* overall: re-unified TOPDIR and PTXDISTDIR to become
	  PTXDIST_DIR now. 
	* makefiles: out-of-tree builds should work now; just 
	  make an empty directory, link the PTXdist toplevel
	  Makefile there and do everything you want. This feature
	  probably needs more testing, but it's a beginning.
	* kconfig/lxdialog: migrated to be hosttools, but still
	  with the strange effect that they need to be in 
	  scripts/* seen from the Makefile. 

2005-11-18 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ntpclient: targetinstall fixed; patch by Steven Scholz

2005-11-14 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	  Mike Wakerly

2005-10-26 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	  to avoid duplicate files in ipkg packets.

2005-10-26 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* release: released PTXdist 0.7.7

2005-10-08 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* epoll: removed rules/epoll.in, seems to be obsolete.
	* rtai: removed rtai in kernel config, could now be done with
	  the patch stack mechanism (in case anybody would be
	  interested)
	* lrzsz: fixed, builds now. Patch by Ladislav Michl, modified
	  to actually build something on targetinstall.
	* dhcp: update from 3.0.1 to 3.0.3; patch by Ulf Samuelsson
	* sysvinit: patch by Oscar Peredo added.
	* zlib: build also static zlib; patch by Kai-Uwe Bloem
	* uclibc: install libthread_db if gdbserver is used; patch by
	  Kai-Uwe Bloem.
	* gettext: fixed stuff all over the place; make ipkg install
	  work. Patch by Kai-Uwe Bloem

2005-09-28 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* Makefile: more makefile cleanups. New policy: everything is
	  now built in a "workspace"; usually nothing changes, but if 
	  you set PTXDISTWORKSPACE we build there. (UPDDATE: this is 
	  PTXDIST_WORKSPACE in more recent versions)
	* paths: moved local_patches to patches; as the patch repository
	  is now in the SVN repository there's no need to copy patches
	  around. Policy: look for patches in $(TOPDIR)/patches and in
	  $(PROJECTDIR)/patches. 
	* toolchains: added gcc 3.3.3 glibc 2.3.2 toolchain
	  for x86, corresponding to arm. Debian is broken at the moment.
	  

2005-09-28 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* misc: removed ptx-init-permissions.sh; this is obsolete now that
	  we have the fakeroot based permission mechanism.

2005-07-16 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ncurese: fixed install names for forms; patch by
	  Steven Scholz. 
	* tcpwrapper: There is a needless builtin dependency 
	  in Portmap_4 for tcpwrapper. Which at the very 
	  least causes excess downloads&compiles. This 
	  patch by David Updegraff detects whether 
	  tcpwrapper was infact explicitly selected or not
	  and deals with it.
	* udev: fixed PTXCONF_ macros. Patch by David Updegraff. 
	* host/cross: fix host paths; patch by Ladislav Michl
	* kernel: use find instead of ls to find files; patch

	  mkimage to version 1.1.2; patch by Ladislav Michl.
	* ipkg: update to 0.99.151; this fixed the problems which
	  previously have been marked by some FIXMEs. Patch by Steven
	  Scholz. UPDATE: patch reverted (rsc); this new version tries

	  the root directory.

	  Scholz.
	* ipkg-push: "wc -w" will never return "1" but "      1".

	  Steven Scholz, modified by Robert Schwebel

	  Patch by Oscar Peredo P. and David Updegraff

	* *.make: added Emacs syntax hints; patch by Christian Gagneraud

2005-05-22 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ltp: initial LTP support
	* glibc: install libc.so.6 instead of libc.so; this does
	  also work with the NATIVE method. 
	* ntp: remove duplicate ntpdc
	* proftpd: update to 1.3.0rc1; patch didn't work
	  with new NATIVE mechanism; fixed. 
	* gdb: select glibc libs only if GLIBC_INSTALL
	* memedit: use default autoconf variables
	* util-linux: update to 2.12j
	* ipkg: added 'make ipkg-push' which updates an ipkg archive
	  from freshly created packets
	* ipkgs: version number is now fixed against PTXdist version;
	  this is necessary because changing options results in
	  different ipkg packets. We now have a project revision 
	  number as well, which does also go into the ipkg packet. 
	* ntp: added ntpd, tools
	* Kconfig: added mechanism for tests

2005-05-19 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* uclibc, crosstool: ported to crosstool 0.32 and fixed
	  the remaining problems. uClibc does now also use the

	  from 2002/12/10. This version of busybox is based on kconfig, 
	  so it is possible to integrate this into our config system again.  

	* general: 0.3.12 finalized; this is an intermediate release; don't 
	  use it for production systems. 

2002-11-16  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: fixed everything to make it work with the new 
	  configuration system

	* config system: ported to use the latest version from linux-2.5.47. 
	  I assume this will be the way to go in the future, as lkc doesn't
	  seem to be supported as a separate package any more. 

	* config system: fixed .config load bug

	* general: 0.3.11 finalized

2002-11-08  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* config system: added lkc support

	* general: 0.3.10 finalized


2002-10-27  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxflash: /tmp and /home directory added

	* general: 0.3.9 finalized. 


2002-10-13  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* glibc: now we install libnss_* to the target, which (surprise!) was
	the reason why proftpd didn't want to let our users login until now. 

	* general: 0.3.8 finalized. 

2002-10-12  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>
	
	* proftpd: added to the distribution.

	* glibc: support for glibc-2.2.3 added

	* general: 0.3.7 finalized.

2002-10-07  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* menuconfig: bug fixed: use correct config file as default

	* lsh: key generation for target does work now. 

	* glibc: option for libm installation added. 

	* general: bugfixing; 0.3.6 finalized.

2002-10-04  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxflash: Utility to make a self contained bootstrap; 
	this is currently highly specific to the MOPSlcd4 board...

	* grub: GNU GRUB can now be installed; you can choose to 
	build a bootdisk for the target system in $PTXDIST/bootdisk.

	* e2fsprog: integrated, so we have mke2fs now. Has to be 
	better configurable.

	* Makefile: rootclean target re-introduced.

	* rtai: RTAI is now integrated. Needs more testing. 

	* config system: version number fixed. The archive target gives a
	warning now, we should change this to a permanent fix. 

	* lsh: lsh added. This requires packets for zlib, libgmp, 
	liboop and nettle which have been installed. 

2002-09-30  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: works now for ARM. The route applet has a bug and 
	cannot be compiled, but this is an upstream problem. 

	* toolchain: first release with a working toolchain! gcc stage
	two is now able to compile kernel 2.4.18, busybox 0.61-pre-ptx1
	and glibc-2.2.5.

	* general: 0.3.4 finalized.  

2002-09-26  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: added a makefile for busybox, currently only for an 
	unstable version from CVS. This will be changed to stable once
	Erik Andersen has made a release. 

	* x86 port: backported makefiles to support compilation for a x86 based
	target system. 

	* toolchain: the cross toolchain does still have major bugs 
	concerning the compiled in paths. 


2002-09-20  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: several bugs fixed which prevented the system from being 
	compiled without having a toolchain right from the beginning. 

	* general: 0.3.2 finalized. This is the first version which has all
	the infrastructure for making a complete cross toolchain for ARM.
