	* Rules.make: added GNU_HOST to get rid of hardcoded x86 compilers
	* config system: ARM architecture dependency fixed
	* glibc: libutil strip fixed
	* general: 0.3.22 released

2003-04-03 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* openssh/openssl: added configuration option
	* x86: configuration re-tested; minor bugs fixed for portmap, 
	  glibc, mtdtools etc., to make this configuration compile again. 
	* general: 0.3.21 released

2003-03-15 Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* portmapper: added version 4
	* tcpwrapper: added version 7.6
	* autoconf257: added autoconf version 2.57, for nfs-utils
	* nfs-utils: version 1.0.1 added

	* general: 0.3.20 finalized

2003-03-05  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* kernel: zImage was accidently always copied to the target
	* rootfs: fixed directory creation bugs
	* rootfs: fixes to make it work with several templates
	* general: 0.3.19 finalized

2003-03-04  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* rules: fix for .get dependencies, introduced get target 
	* general: 0.3.18 finalized

2003-03-04  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* kernel: workaround for xchain-kernel kernel sources
	* zlib: dependency bug fixed; separated into zlib and xchain-zlib.
	* general: 0.3.17 finalized

2003-03-02  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* config system: updated to the linux-2.5.63 version of kconfig and
	  lxdialog. Fixed missing 'make clean' for lxdialog. 
	* kernel: new config options for choosing which kernel image format
	  shall be used. The kernel can now optionally be installed on the 
	  target system (e.g. for jffs partitions). 
	* kernel: split kernel package into kernel and xchain-kernel. This
	  avoids that the complete toolchain is recompiled when you change
	  something for the kernel (like patching it with RTAI). 
	* mtd: added package for MTD CVS snapshots, including the MTD user
	  space utilities. 
	* general: 0.3.16 finalized

2003-02-17  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ncurses: made ncurses compile with i386 cross environment
	* rtai: separated rtai-patches from other rtai stuff
	* glibc: fixed gcc-2.95.3 bug for x86
	* general: 0.3.15 finalized

2003-01-28  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* openssl,openssh: added initial support (untested)
	* busybox: fixed configuration for strange register dump problem. 
	  XScale environment can be compiled now. 
	* general: 0.3.14 finalized


2003-01-14  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: kconfig transition finished. This should work now. 
	
	* general: 0.3.13 finalized

2003-01-11  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>
	
	* busybox: busybox-0.61.pre-ptx3 added, based on CVS snapshot 
	  from 2002/12/10. This version of busybox is based on kconfig, 
	  so it is possible to integrate this into our config system again.  

	* general: 0.3.12 finalized; this is an intermediate release; don't 
	  use it for production systems. 

2002-11-16  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: fixed everything to make it work with the new 
	  configuration system

	* config system: ported to use the latest version from linux-2.5.47. 
	  I assume this will be the way to go in the future, as lkc doesn't
	  seem to be supported as a separate package any more. 

	* config system: fixed .config load bug

	* general: 0.3.11 finalized

2002-11-08  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* config system: added lkc support

	* general: 0.3.10 finalized


2002-10-27  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxflash: /tmp and /home directory added

	* general: 0.3.9 finalized. 


2002-10-13  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* glibc: now we install libnss_* to the target, which (surprise!) was
	the reason why proftpd didn't want to let our users login until now. 

	* general: 0.3.8 finalized. 

2002-10-12  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>
	
	* proftpd: added to the distribution.

	* glibc: support for glibc-2.2.3 added

	* general: 0.3.7 finalized.

2002-10-07  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* menuconfig: bug fixed: use correct config file as default

	* lsh: key generation for target does work now. 

	* glibc: option for libm installation added. 

	* general: bugfixing; 0.3.6 finalized.

2002-10-04  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* ptxflash: Utility to make a self contained bootstrap; 
	this is currently highly specific to the MOPSlcd4 board...

	* grub: GNU GRUB can now be installed; you can choose to 
	build a bootdisk for the target system in $PTXDIST/bootdisk.

	* e2fsprog: integrated, so we have mke2fs now. Has to be 
	better configurable.

	* Makefile: rootclean target re-introduced.

	* rtai: RTAI is now integrated. Needs more testing. 

	* config system: version number fixed. The archive target gives a
	warning now, we should change this to a permanent fix. 

	* lsh: lsh added. This requires packets for zlib, libgmp, 
	liboop and nettle which have been installed. 

2002-09-30  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: works now for ARM. The route applet has a bug and 
	cannot be compiled, but this is an upstream problem. 

	* toolchain: first release with a working toolchain! gcc stage
	two is now able to compile kernel 2.4.18, busybox 0.61-pre-ptx1
	and glibc-2.2.5.

	* general: 0.3.4 finalized.  

2002-09-26  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* busybox: added a makefile for busybox, currently only for an 
	unstable version from CVS. This will be changed to stable once
	Erik Andersen has made a release. 

	* x86 port: backported makefiles to support compilation for a x86 based
	target system. 

	* toolchain: the cross toolchain does still have major bugs 
	concerning the compiled in paths. 


2002-09-20  Robert Schwebel <r.schwebel@pengutronix.de>

	* general: several bugs fixed which prevented the system from being 
	compiled without having a toolchain right from the beginning. 

	* general: 0.3.2 finalized. This is the first version which has all
	the infrastructure for making a complete cross toolchain for ARM.
