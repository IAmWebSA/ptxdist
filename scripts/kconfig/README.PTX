README.PTX
==========

This is a copy of the linux-2.6.14 scripts/kconfig directory. The only
modification is the Makefile, which comes from an old version of kconfig
(standalone version 1.4, patched with kconfig-Makefile.diff) and the
kconfig.diff patch. 

To update to a new kconfig version copy the kconfig directory from the kernel
and replace Makefile with that one to be found in ../ptx-modifications and 
apply the patches.
