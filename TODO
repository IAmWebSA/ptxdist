TODO before 2.0.0
=================

Prio A
[ ] jbe: libcgicc: Runs host's autotools when the compile stage starts on some
    systems (*not* on himalia). On system where it does not run the autotools
    the compile stage fails with:
      make[3]: Entering directory `[....]/platform-i586/build-target/cgicc-3.2.7/doc'
       if test ! -d html; then \
             mkdir html; \
       fi;
       DATE=`date '+%-d %b %Y'` VERSION=3.2.7 /bin/echo Doxyfile
       Doxyfile
       cp cgicc.png gnu-head-sm.jpg cgicc-doc.css html
       mv html/index.html html/index.html.bak
       mv: cannot stat `html/index.html': No such file or directory

[ ] jbe: phyton24 states this but does not stop the build (in the install stage):
      cannot find -lncursesw
      collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
      cannot find -lpanelw
      collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

[ ] jbe: Working with local sources seems broken, when a <PACKET_NAME>_SOURCE
    is defined to the regular $(SRCDIR)/<PACKET_NAME>. The get stage fails in
    this case. Our template will always create and fill this variable. Don't
    know if this is intended and the failure is elsewhere.

[ ] rsc: in x86 simulation: ipkg list doesn't work?

[ ] jbe: avoid the convenience stage question, when running "pxtdist images".
    jbe: avoid the convenience stage question again and again and again....

[ ] rsc: 'ptxdist images' for the i586 target sometimes does not work,
    the generated image is incorrect and grub stops booting.

[ ] rsc: network handling with qemu does not work reliably; it works
    when being run with sudo (see start/stop/connect scripts in i586) and
    /dev/net/tun must be made rwrwrw.

[ ] jbe: Would it be possible to delete a directory defined by PTXCONF_SYSROOT_TARGET
    in the form "${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local/${PTXCONF_ARCH_STRING}"
    Currently the "local" part still exists when running "ptxdist clean".
    This is for ptxdist-1 backward compatibility.

[ ] bbu: default path to generic projects seems not work

[ ] mkl/jbe: Host's environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH leaks into PTXdist's build
	Audit other environment variables also!

[.] jbe: it seems to extract a kernel always touches the local
	 kernelconfig.target (or similar). This confuses svn, as
	 this file always changes without calling "ptxdist kernelconfig"
    rsc: mol has a patch for this, integrate

[ ] lfu: some mountable devices are available after udev started. hence
	we need an extra mount script to mount all entries in fstab instead
	out of rcS

[ ] rsc: add bbu's "get" script

[ ] rsc: fix 'ptxdist newpacket host'; find out what mkl intended with
    this "class" mechanism and make sure it produces sane output. Check
    with mkl.

    Example: ptxdist newpacket host-existing-target:

    - asks for version number, which should be derived from existing
      target version
    - asks for URL, but we want to use the download mechanics from
      target
    - should output warning that you have to change := into = for
      corresponding target packet

[ ] discuss UID of user "rpcuser"

[ ] discuss UIDs and GIDs of other important system users

[ ] ipkg with dependecies

Prio B
------

[ ] jbe: avoid the "make: Nothing to be done for `world'." message when running
    a "ptxdist images".

[ ] jbe: Can we also provide a "Bare Metall" platform project to show how to use
    ptxdist2 for non Linux targets?

[ ] jbe: Segmentation fault?

    -----------------------
    target: locales.install
    -----------------------

    generating "en_US" - this can take some time
    /work/ptxdist-trunk/scripts/make_locale.sh: line 29: 14673 Segmentation fault \
         I18NPATH=${SYSROOT_USR}/share/i18n ${LOCALEDEF} ${ENDIAN} -i $LOCALE_DEF \
         -f ${CHARMAP} --prefix=${PREF} $LOCALE_NAME
    calling localedef binary failed

[ ] jbe: e2fsprogs: HTREE can be disabled, but at least mkfs.ext2 creates (silently)
    a HTREE based filesystem! e2fsck will fail on such a filesystem unless HTREE
    support will be activated in the menu!

[ ] jbe: udev seems to load kernel modules by its own. How to disable it?

[ ] mkl: reactiveate new install_copy feature (no explicid destination)
    rsc: ask mkl what kind of problems have been observed with the old
    implementation that has been thrown out again

Prio C
------

[ ] jbe: Would it be possible to omit the "ptxconfig" and "platformconfig" menu entries
    when run "ptxdist menu" when the "selected_ptxconfig" and "selected_platformconfig"
    are real files than links (or not exist yet)? If they are real files, the project
    is a single platform one. There is no need for this step!

[ ] jbe: Shown pathes are much too long in "ptxconfig" and "platformconfig"
    while running "ptxdist menu"

[ ] jbe: We should provide a solution if someone selects "ptx" or
    "platform" while running "ptxdist menu" and these files are not new enough.
    (happens if someone wants to upgrade his ptxdist-1 based BSP). Currently
    there is only a error message, one should use "--force". Its correct, but
    is doesn't help! M$ help level!

    -> integrate --force into dialogs

[ ] jbe: Running "ptxdist menu" shows always a "u-boot-v2" entry that fails
    if called even if the platformconfig do not use u-boot-v2

[ ] rsc: add 'quiet' support to start scripts (probably centralized in rcS)

[ ] jbe: most of the time thttpd does not respond to the USR1 signal.
	  - the start/stop script fails to stop this service

Unclear
-------

[ ] bbu, lfu, rsc, sha: "bspfix feature"

    Usecase:

    * create BSP config with "ptxdist menuconfig"
    * "ptxdist bspfix [bspfix-name]" (creates 2nd config internally)
    * user makes changes to the software config (menuconfig) and saves
    * some kind of "diff" is made between "selected_platformconfig" and
      bspfix-config
    * if user has one or several "bspfixes" around, they are patched into
      his ptxconfig on the fly

    Aims:

    * developer: can create their own local modifications of the bsp,
      without destroying the official one
    * customer: can make his own changes ontop of our releases; changes
      are easy to move forward

[ ] bbu, lfu, rsc, sha: "packet sets"

    Observations / Ideas:

    * "modularity" doesn't fit our needs; we don't only want to build
      the base packages plus all modules; it is more something like:
      "build minimum set", or "build minimu set + feature x"

    * "packet sets" are lists of packages

    Use Cases:

    * "ptxdist --pkgset=base go" builds the package set "base"
    * "ptxdist --pkgset=headless_rt go" builds the package set "headless_rt"
    * "ptxdist --pkgset=all go" builds all selected packages
    * "ptxdist pkgset <pkgset>" creates "selected_pkgset" and makes it
      the default for subsequent commands
      FIXME: find location for pkgset files

    Necessary:

    * separate "targetinstall" stage from "ipkg -> root/image"
    * How to call this?
    * API? "ptxdist --pkgset=<pkgset> foobar" installs root/ and image.blub from ipkgs

Before Release
--------------

[ ] rsc: we need a "tested distros" strategy for 2.0.0, with
    pre-packaged toolchains.

[ ] rsc: run dependency hunter and fix all remaining dependency problems

[ ] update ChangeLog

[ ] jbe: Generic projects must be audited carefully prior any release. For the
	 0.10.6 release, ARM and PowerPC projects where updated, but the x86
	 project was/is still on 0.10.5!

[ ] jbe: review all READMEs, COMPILE-TESTs, SPECIFICATIONs and so on files
	 in the ptxdist install folder. Most of them are trash only

[ ] jbe, rsc: add sane minimal in-system documentation

[ ] bbu: check ptxdist first-time-usage scenario for chicken-egg problems
         e.g. if you don´t set sane defaults for PTXCONF_SETUP_PROJECTPATH,
	 ptxdist won´t find its own projects.


TODO before 2.1.0
=================

[ ] rsc: 'ptxdist print <variable>' is pretty slow now; shall work with retval=0
    if variable exists and retval!=0 if not

[ ] jbe: Would there be a solution to supress sysroot-* folders for target system
    (for example bare metall) that do not need a Unix filesystem?

[ ] jbe: it must be possible to force some userland components from inside the
    platformconfig. For example a platform specific kernel driver module
    needs a special component of the UDEV. Currently it does not work.
    Duplicating symbols in both config files may work, but it will be
    "BROKEN BY DESIGN".

[ ] rsc: configure continues, even if a test breaks. Example:
    checking lex library... sed: couldn't write 76 items to stdout: No space left on device
    grep: write error: No space left on device
    sed: couldn't write 46 items to stdout: No space left on device
    none needed
    checking whether yytext is a pointer... sed: couldn't write 29 items to stdout: No space left on device
    no
    [...anything proceeds...]

[ ] jbe: working with hd.img is very delicate. The incomplete partition table
	 confuses the linux kernel, so any rewrite of the image after done
	 one time fails with "no space left on device". Also fdisk fails
	 when trying to repair this partition table. Only Windows can
	 rewrite the partition table in this case. After this, also Linux
	 is able to write to the hard disk again!
	 But the BIOS and Kernel on target side are successfull. Problem
	 happend on SUSE-10.1 on host side and an USB to IDE adapter
	 to initial write the hd.img to the harddisk.

[ ] bbu: Discuss the future kconfig include scheme. At the moment, overriding
	 single *.in files is a real pain.

	 - There should be a way to autogenerate the needed files
	   before starting kconfig or kconfig should just ignore
	   double definitions (which might be a bad idea)

	 Features needed:

	 - override *.make as well as *.in
	 - create a sane menu structure


TODO somewhen
=============

[ ] mol: bash configure --enable-job-control does not work when cross compiling
         posible fix in:
         https://iocaste.extern.pengutronix.de/svn/oselas/bsp/johndeere/OSELAS.BSP-JohnDeere-ComPC-trunk/rules/bash.make
         explained here:
         http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-bash%40gnu.org/msg03107.html

[ ] bbu: add more real GNU coreutils

[ ] jbe: review samba configure stage. For a non-root and cross-compile run it
	seems to omit many tests and switches of many features in the final
	application.
	-> check if samba_cv_HAVE_IFACE_IFCONF=yes and samba_cv_HAVE_MMAP=yes
	   can be used all over all architectures as defaults

[ ] bbu: add minimal documentation for internal vars (useful for customer makefiles)
	-> see manual (not quickstart)

[ ] rsc: fix python

[ ] jbe: samba fails to run with:
	[...]
	sys_gethostbyname: Unknown host. eth0
	can't determine netmask for eth0
	WARNING: no network interfaces found
	[...]
	Seems to be a failure with current glibc

[ ] rsc: find out why iproute2 needs berkeley-db

[ ] rsc: xorg-app-xkbcomp needs xorg-lib-xkbfile, but dependency doesn't
         work

[ ] rsc: xorg-data-xkbdata needs xkbcomp on the host - otherwhise we get
         a circular dependency ...

[ ] jbe: Current implementation of "screen" is useless due to lack of
         generic configuration

[ ] jbe: alsa-lib creates funny pathes at the install stage

[ ] jbe: org-server fails if no xkbfile is selected

[ ] jbe: use tmpfs everywhere instead of the ramfs

[ ] jbe: audit BROKEN marked packages

[ ] lfu: often used config files for X like xorg.conf or xinitrd shall be
	integrated into ptxdist generic files. the installation shall follow
	the scheme of other rootfs configuration files

[ ] bbu: Discuss the whole definition of "package". At the moment,
	 most package options are scattered across two or more
	 *.in or *.make files, making "drop-in replacements" nearly
	 impossible.

[ ] jbe: audit all packages if they change the target CPU (with --march
         or --mtune); openssl does so

[ ] jbe: uRamdisk should be built from ipkg packages instead of root/ content!

[ ] jbe: Adding "ant" to the required host tools. Emit a warning if its not
    present, but not fail (required only to build jvisu)

    Update 2007-01-24:	rsc: rejected. Ant is only needed by tools which
			use Java, and we don't want a prerequisite to
			java in PTXdist. Maybe add some loud warning if
			packets are built which use java, such as jvisu.

[ ] jbe: why does fam-2.7.0 always try to run the autotools? It fails on most
    modern systems -> mark as broken. rsc: real fix: find out why and fix.

[ ] jbe: replacing an *.make file for project use is easy. But how to
    replace a *.in file? rsc: no 0.10.6 issue, defer

    rsc: We have a problem with the dependency generator: if we have a
    packet which is already in ptxdist a second time in the local
    project, ptxdist includes _both_ .in files, resulting in the
    dependencies from the ptxdist version being superimposed on the
    local project ones.

    jbe: correct the ouput of "ptxdist menuconfig" when configuration is finished.
    The output of
    *** End of configuration.
    *** Execute 'make' to build the project or try 'make help'.
    is outdated...

    rsc: while doing this, update to a recent kconfig version, with
    saner colours instead of this unreadable yellow.

[ ] feature request: add profiling support (kernel and userspace)
    best with host visualisation

[ ] jbe: more help texts

[ ] bbu: reimplement cuckoo-test
	 - files w/ wrong build-arch
	 - missing libs
	 - statistics
	 - stripped / non stripped files

[ ] bbu: reimplement generic pre- and post-flight checks
	 - dependency checks
	 - cuckoo-test
	 - user defined checks
	 - package tests
	 - in-system test -> ltp

[ ] bbu: generic logging aproach w/ single and combined logs
	 - combined log for normal use
	 - build-logs per package, test-suite, etc would
	   support features like
	   	- "quiet build", while still providing the full error
		   output of the failing target
		- helpdesk notification fetaures
	 	- build statistics
	 	- better support for GUI driven builds

[ ] bbu,rsc,mkl: brain storming session

	Discussion about the whole PTXdist build-,
	deployment- and testing-mechanics:

	- Support different target package formats
	  Rationale: - Some standardization aproaches like carrier grade linux
		       or the linux standard base make rpm or dpk packages
		       mandatory.
		     - Users asked for it
	  Which package formats would be useful ?
	  		- ipkg
			- deb
			- rpm
			- openpkg
			- plain directory tree / tar[.gz]
	  ! Depends: Check rpm and deb database footprint
	  ! Depends: Discussion about the current installation scheme

	- Support binary package distribution
	  Rationale: Most Customers don´t want to build the
	  	     base System on their own. They want a
		     well defined base system and then apply
		     some changes, add files (probably on the fly)
		     by installing binary packages.
	  ! Problem: This might break the current PTXdist philosophy
	  	     (executeable documentation)
	  ! Depends: We would need some kind of install-filter or exclude-list

	- Deployment / Testing Frontend (maybe GUI driven)
	  Rationale: needed in a binary package distribution scenario
	  	     to customize the installation from a generic
		     binary package.

	- Support precompiled customer environment
	  Rationale: This would reduce compile times for
	  	     the customer, since he would start
		     directly w/ his own application
		     w/o the need for a full ptxdist run.
	  ! Problem: Build Hierarchy is not relocateable
	  	     -> libtool problems
	  ! Problem: Make depends on timestamps
	  Possible solutions:
	  	     - create intermediate build labels / paths
		     - tweak things during installation
		       (dirty, dirty ... how do we handle updates?)
		     - Provide a "full blown" toolchain with all
		       host-tools and chroot into it
		       (dirty, dirty ... needs root privileges)
		     - Provide a "full blown" toolchain with all
		       host-tools inside a virtual machine,
		       vmware image or CoLinux
		       (dirty, slow, but runs even with Windows)
		       (nasty, since it would be some kind of closed box solution)
		       (problem: how do we handle alternative toolchains in this case?)

	- Support Partitioned Images
	  ! Problem: We don´t want to use root privileges
	  ! Problem: Generate valid Partition Tables
	  ! Problem: ipkg list has to work inside the
		     target system, so we would need
		     two or more diffenrent installation "views":
		     - The partition image generation view,
		       which
		       a) respects partition boundaries
		       b) rewrites the resulting installation
		          paths respectively.
		     - The binary target package view (i.e. ipkg)
		       which
		       a) generates apropriate pre- and post-
		          installation scripts to i.e. remount
			  the partitions read/write
		       b) creates binary packages, rooted in
		          "/" on the target.
		     - An optional "user-view", where something
		       else can happen, i.e. transfering stuff
		       to an ftp server or mounting an image
		       with root privileges or as user via fuse.

	- TODO:

			- What does $JON_DOE_HACKER _need_
			- What does $CUSTOMER  want

[ ] Problem: When doing things like "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=bla something",

DONE
====

[x] migrate libc from ptxconfig to platform

[x] rsc: config dependency dropper doesn't work yet; it assumes that all
    labels correspond to their package names, but that's not true for
    busybox, so the dropping doesn't work for bb. The right solution would be
    to change PTXCONF_BB_ to PTXCONF_BUSYBOX__, but that would break all
    migrations of old projects. Can only be done with a proper migration
    script.

[x] Subject: Re: [ptxdist-commit] ptxdist r9228 - in trunks/ptxdist-trunk/patches:
    libffi-3.0.7 libffi-3.0.7/generic

    I am not sure this is the correct fix. The problem seems that ptxdist
    uses ac_cv_sizeof_long_double with a value of 8, and that is where the
    problem is, because that should be 12 on x86 and 16 on x86_64. That
    error results in double and long double to have the same size and
    configure to conclude there is no long double. And since that is never
    true on x86 with gcc, there was no need for the ifdef with
    HAVE_LONGDOUBLE in the x86 case.

    - Erwin

    rsc: add proper definitions according to platform definition
    (PTXCONF_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE)

[x] rsc: fix install_copy without source+destination; it worked before
    with destination-only, but there was some problem. Ask mkl.

    Update 20081228: rsc: seems like it works in the current trunk.

[x] rsc: autogenerated menues with overwriting.

    20081109 mkl:

    [x] directfb
    [x] xorg
    [x] gtk
    [x] bluez
    [x] crosstools
    [x] debug
    [x] gdb
    [x] gtk
    [x] host-gtk
    [x] hosttools
    [x] libc
    [x] ltp
    [x] net-sec
    [x] networking
    [x] ntp
    [x] sdl
    [x] tests
    [x] wireless
    [x] xorg

    still have to be migrated

[x] jbe: Getting the value of an internal ptxdist variable returns always 1 as
    its exit code ("ptxdist print ROOTDIR" returns with the correct value on stdout
    but with exit code = 1)

    Update 20081227: rsc: fixed, but now 'ptxdist print' is pretty slow.

[x] when the drop command is used without a stage, complain about that
    and suggest to use clean instead

[x] jbe: When someone do not need a Linux kernel one earns:
    <ptxdist/install/path>rules/kernel.make:109: warning: ignoring old commands for target
    `<path/to/current/BSP/directory>'

[x] rsc: fallback server for udev

[x] rsc: toolchain selection doesn't work if gcc revision is empty=nocheck

[x] rsc: platformconfig: check what about PTXCONF_IMAGE_IPKG_ARCH; it
    should go to the platformconfig code.

    arm -> oabi
    armel -> eabi little endian
    armeb -> eabi big endian

    This would make our packages compatible with maemo + debian

    [x] 20081107 mkl: we use not PTXDIST_IPKG_ARCH_STRING which is generated in
		      scripts/lib/ptxd_make_install.sh

[x] rsc: we don't seem to have a target option for the endianess!

[x] rsc: SuSE has an old stat version which doesn't support --printf;
    this breaks building of hd.img. Add test to configure.

    [x] 20081107 mkl: we use "stat -c" now

[x] jbe: When someone do not need u-boot-v2 one earns:
    <ptxdist/install/path>/rules/u-boot-v2.make:80: warning: overriding commands for
        target `<path/to/current/BSP/directory>'

[x] jbe: Fix the too many --without-pam and the always --without-sendmail given
    in the sudo.make in the prepare step
    rsc: fixed by cleaning up package and disabling all untested things

[x] jbe: if the kernel.extract stage fails, ptxdist returns with exit code 0
    Can be replicated by deleting the configures series file for the patch
    stack in use.

[x] BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as
    fallback (e.g. mirrors)

[x] add menu entry for user local config files in /etc

[x] mol: ptxdist commands behave differently for arguments which exceed
    the "current" command; some continue parsing and some exit.

[-] Start a "Global Patch Repository Unification Project". Potential
    members:

    	* PTXdist
	* T2
	* OpenEmbedded
	  http://www.openembedded.org/repo/org.openembedded.dev/packages/
	* Gentoo
	* Debian

[x] bbu: audit *.in and *.make files, broken install definitions everywhere [tm]
	 (mostly c&p errors, probably)

[x] repair make makro 'install'; there are sometimes three """.
    See procps.install for reference.

[x] jbe: reduce directory count on top level, combine build-* and
    local-* into a shared subdir rsc: we've agreed on this variant:

    	build-host/
	build-target/
	build-cross/
	local/
	local-target/
	local-cross/

[x] jbe: cleanup rules/other/Toplevel.make

[x] jbe: remove ptxdist's documentation from the installation.
	 It's now useless and outdated as a better alternative
	 is present with the application notes

[x] jbe: hd images must be built from ipkgs to support the ipkg tool
	 on the target

[x] if a packet is not selected, it's dependencies are not generated. If
    you kick a stage then, the dependend stages are not executed.
    Solution: generate the stages as well, so we get an error in that
    case.

[x] RSC:is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??

[x] jbe: Switching from generating hd image to jffs2 image _rebuilds_
	 the the whole project!

	 Known Problem: the virtual-cross-tools depends on host-mtd-utils,
	 which is selected by JFFS2. this must depend on images somewhere.
	 mkl knows how to fix it...

[x] jbe: current trunk complains
	glib.make:40: warning: overriding commands for target `/home/all_src/glib-2.8.6.tar.bz2'
	host-glib.make:38: warning: ignoring old commands for target `/home/all_src/glib-2.8.6.tar.bz2'

[x] jbe: if the "ptxdist toolchain" step was omited, ptxdist complains
	 about toolchain vendor instead of missing toolchain

[x] jbe: if ptxdist was called with wrong parameters (and complains about it) it
	 should return also an error return code (so something like
	 "ptxdist clen kernel && ptxdist go" fails)

[x] jbe: ipkg does not work on the target anymore. Cannot install anything.

[x] jbe: suppress cross toolchain and toolchain vendor check while --native build

[x] rsc: put export LANG=C somewhere into PTXdist, to make compiler
         output more readable

[x] jbe: libxcb depends on host's xslt installation! Current fix is to be checked.

[x] jbe: xcb-proto depends on host's xmllint!

[x] jbe:
    ptxdist: platformconfig...
    platforms/images.in:14:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'IMAGE_HD' refers to undefined symbol 'HOST_GENPART'
    platforms/images.in:193:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'IMAGE_JFFS2' refers to undefined symbol 'HOST_MTD_UTILS'
    platforms/images.in:226:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'IMAGE_UIMAGE' refers to undefined symbol 'HOST_UMKIMAGE'
    platforms/images.in:271:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'IMAGE_EXT2' refers to undefined symbol 'HOST_GENEXT2FS'

[x] jbe: add help what symbol "PTXCONF_PLATFORM" should contain (or what it
    means if this entry is still empty)

[x] jbe: "ptxdist help" does not output the new option "platformconfig"


[x] jbe: if the ptx dialog will be called from within the menu dialog the loop
    should stop, if calling the ptx dialog resturns with an error. In one case
    one of the *.in files was missed and the error message can't be read
    because the menu dialog overwrite it immediately

[x] jbe: udev. Generic startscript complains about a missing udev-adm

[x] jbe: fakeroot seems to have problems to run in a 64 bit environment. Not
	 at the image creation stage, only at the "install" stage
	 Update:
	 - fakeroot fails on all glibc 2.5 based systems

[x] jbe: rules file for zlib is broken since ptxdist-0.10.6!
	 What the hell means libz.so.0.0.0???? In ptxdist-0.10.5 it was libz.so.1.2.3!

[x] jbe: transfer ipkg's runtime configuration to the ipkg packet itself
	-> its not rootfs

[x] jbe: uboot-1.2.0's build system is not multi processor save
	-> supress -j option

[x] pureftp's configure runs twice and needs host's autotools!

[x] audit the logfile of AllYesArm for autotool calls

    Update 2007-01-24:	rsc: the solution is simple: just add
    			AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to the configure.in/ac if the
			autotools are re-run. This avoids that the
			maintainer dependencies are put into the packet.

   [x] util-linux: re-calls automake during compile;
   [x] libxslt: re-calls automake during compile
   [x] pure-ftpd: re-calls automake during compile

[x] jbe: all local sources (file://) are still do a touch into the package directory.
    (into "Source Directory"). If this file gets deleted, ptxdist builds the whole
    package again (and recreate the file in the Source Directory).

    Update 2007-01-24:	fixed; order of PACKET-empty check in extract
    			was changed.

[x] jbe: Chrony fails to compile

    Update 2007-01-25:	jbe: better fix; force chrony to use the wide ncurses lib
			if present, else the non wide one
    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: fixed; ncurses didn't install the
			non-widechar variants of the libraries.

[x] OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-TechPool-trunk$ p select ptxconfig.dotgnu
    /home/rsc/svn/ptxdist-trunk/scripts/libptxdist.sh: line 26:
    /media/rscusb1_plain/svn/oselas/bsp/pengutronix/huettinger/OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-TechPool-trunk/ptxconfig:
    No such file or directory

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: fixed

[x] jbe: starting with a new and empty project should provide the user with
    a generic (and default) ptxconfig instead of an error message.
    But it should not do it automatically! It should ask before doing it!
    Otherwise we will end up with many ptxconfig files in many directories...

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: it's not so easy as "touch ptxconfig &&
			ptxdist oldconfig". Error message is improved
			the preferred way to start a new project is
			cloning.

[x] jbe: host-mknbi fails to build

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: doesn't work, hasn't for ages, deleted

[x] jbe: liboldX fails to build the ipkg but the build continues!

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: fixed

[x] unbreak host-zlib; it is necessary for host-umkimage if there is no
    zlib devel packet installed on the host.

[x] omitting glibc installation should be possible, first hack attempt
    done

    Update 2007-01-12:	No idea what the reason was; we don't have a
    			concept for anything else than shared libs and
			glibc.

[x] rsc: fakeroot-the-hosttool seems not to be found - reported by wrap. It
    looks to me as if $(PTXDIST_WORKSPACE)/local/bin has to be included
    into the path somehow. Ask mkl.

[x] Our current host tools use their target counterparts for getting the
    sources; if the target counterpart is not selected, the dependencies
    are not created correctly! Test: switch off ipkg but activate
    host-ipkg.

[x] audit 'get' stage

[x] Menu Structure
    JBE: Use menuconfig instead of menu + configs whereever possible.
    It looks nicer in "menuconfig" and its much better supported when using
    "xconfig"

[x] ptxdist should reject working as ROOT

[x] add prerequisite checks to configure script; find out which
    prerequisites we really need.

[x] Toolchain selection
    JBE:  add an identifier to a (central) toolchain (in "make setup").
    It should be possible to use more than one toolchain in a local
    ptxdist folder (for different targets/projects). So the idetifier
    selects the right toolchain for this project. This identifier
    simplifies the toolchain selection. There could be a central
    folder in the system with all informations (and identifiers)
    about any available toolchain installed on this system.
	 --> done: "ptxdist toolchain path" per project

[x] discuss UID of user "nobody" and GID of "nogroup"

[x] jbe: ptxdist images fails for jffs2 fileimage creation
	it seems local-host/sbin is not in the PATH

[x] jbe: procps.install stage fails with:

	make: Ungültige Option -- y
	make: Ungültige Option -- y
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /

	Seems the install macro emits: make [...] CFLAGS=""" LDFLAGS=""" [...]

[x] jbe: udev needs rules to control permissions on device nodes; jbe
    currently writes docs for this.

[x] jbe/rsc: /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf:
    Find a solution to generate DNS configuration files from other sources
    like boardsetup (I have no clue what this means).
    "Then either have no resolv.conf at all (use /etc/hosts only), or generate
    resolv.conf from 'ptxdist boardsetup' information and generate a
    sane nsswitch.conf."

[x] rsc: check if we can update mtd-utils from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1; mkl has
    already prepared the patches; find out why the revision number was
    not bumped. mkl: 1.0.1 needs acl, so we stay with 1.0.0

[x] ssh: server start scripts are missing

[x] ssh: key gen mechanics needed

[x] dbus needs user messagebus -> /etc/passwd; jbe: needs other user,
    non-root; add this user to /etc/passwd. Debian has a user called
    "messagebus", we should do it the same way. Define a sane UID (ask
    jbe)

[x] rsc: find out why mkl added this new dependency mechanism which
    searches for ${${LABEL}_DIR}/.ptx-extract.

[x] rsc: merge mkl's host/cross/target-pkg-config fixes. We need this to
    have a proper x.org and host-dbus.

[x] jbe: make DHCP client useful on the target. Currently only the binary
    will be built and copied, but does not work on the target

[x] jbe: update DHCP tp 3.0.5 or correct path to 3.0.4

[x] jbe: creating links into non existent directories fails, but does
    not break the build!

    Update 2007-01-12:	rsc/mkl: the install_link macro has mkdir -p
			calls in all relevant places; should not
			happen -> jbe: retest.
