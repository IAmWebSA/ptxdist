TODO for PTXdist 0.10 Series - High Priority
============================================

[ ] modify macros to use FOOBAR instead of $(FOOBAR_DIR) etc.; see
    install macro for example. 
[ ] add prerequisite checks to configure script; find out which
    prerequisites we really need. 
[ ] check if ${PTXCONF_PREFIX} can be written to and barf if not
[ ] add sanity checks for all user configurable variables (especially
    paths)
[ ] audit project files for CROSS_AUTOCONF
[ ] Problem: When doing things like "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=bla something",
    something does not inherit the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH. 
    To achieve this properly, we need to export these variables to the 
    calling shell. The same applies to lots of variables from
    Rules.make. 
[ ] Write macros $(call compile) and $(call configure). 
[ ] libxslt crypto support is broken

Test suite components to be added
=================================

[ ] RSC: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/tooltable.php
[ ] RSC: Add more test suite stuff:
    http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html
    http://www.plumhall.com/stec.html
[ ] RSC: lmbench
[ ] RSC: add regression tests from crosstool
[ ] RSC: look at Herbert Poetzl's cross test stuff:
       	 20040224182505.GA25038@MAIL.13thfloor.at
         Update: seems to have disappeared. 
[ ] RSC: look at Linux Kernel Headers project:

Current TODO List
=================

[ ] ptxdist arch <arm|um|ppc|....>

    Split build-target into build-${PTXCONF_ARCH}

[ ] RSC: port XOrg 7.0

    Requirements, according to
    http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide

	[x] pkg-config > 0.18 
	[ ] write test in configure to check for >0.18!
	[x] expat 1.95.8
	[x] freetype 1.2.9
	[x] fontconfig-2.2.3 recommendet, we have 2.2.99 (latest 2.2)
	[x] libpng 1.2.8
	[x] libdrm 2.0
	[x] zlib 1.2.3
	[x] mesa 6.4.1

    Things noticed during xorg port: 

	[ ] address PTXCONF_XORG_SERVER_QUIRKS by sane upstream patching
	[ ] check ac_cv_* variables - they are problably not really 
	    needed, at least not all of them.

[ ] Tree Structure
    RSC: Find sane place for generic files from projects/generic
    ERO: Make subdirectories, e.g. for x.org stuff. Might use symlinks
    to avoid changing the scripts. 
    SHA: push make and in files into subdirs, add patches to that dirs
    as well. 

[ ] Menu Structure
    JBE: Use menuconfig instead of menu + configs whereever possible.
    It looks nicer in "menuconfig" and its much better supported when using
    "xconfig"

[ ] Program Name Sorting
    JBE: Sort program entries in "Shell & Console Tools" and other menus by
    function, not by program name! Especially if there is more than one
    program that can do the job (see menu entries "Apache 1", "Apache 2" and
    "thttpd").  To be more concise the whole group should have a checkbox.
    Not until someone unlocks the "HTTP Server" group he can see the
    programs in this group.
    RSC: Please let's stay with alphabetic sorting in the menues. You
    don't find programs any more otherwhise. If the structure is not
    clear enough we should clean it up. 

[ ] Graphical Configurator
    JBE:  For a graphical configurator instead of the ncurses one:
    Maybe ship a static linked "qconfig" version, otherwise the
    user also has to install the qt development libraries
    Same with ncurses (menuconfig), or the user has to be forced
    to install the development libraries for ncurses
    RSC: good idea, but only for customer packets. Maybe this will
    become obsolete when we have a good Eclipse based configurator. 

[ ] JBE:  Make target "qconfig" starts target "oldconfig", even if
    the configuration was aborted! Target "menuconfig" doesn't

[ ] Toolchain selection
    JBE:  add an identifier to a (central) toolchain (in "make setup").
    It should be possible to use more than one toolchain in a local
    ptxdist folder (for different targets/projects). So the idetifier
    selects the right toolchain for this project. This identifier
    simplifies the toolchain selection. There could be a central
    folder in the system with all informations (and identifiers)
    about any available toolchain installed on this system.

[ ] Startup Documentation
    JBE: add documentation to start from scratch with "make setup"
    this menu should provide the toolchain, all pathes to everything
    (also to a prebuilt toochain). All other targets should be project
    specific.

[ ] JBE: more help texts

[ ] RSC: make projects doesn't find local_projects/something, if
    something is a softlink and not a directory.

[ ] RSC: replace perl by (modern) sed -i (hosttool)

[ ] RSC: Do ipkg stuff during make images

[ ] RSC: in NATIVE=1 mode libpthread.so.0 is not copied; find out why

[ ] MKL: let get stages depend on the actual makefile

[ ] RSC: Finish autotoolisation of chrony. The old features from the
    handwritten configure script have to be added; readline dependency
    is now temporarily fixed, it should be made optional again.

[ ] RSC:sed: replace all "sed" occurences by $(SED) and maybe switch to
    a newer GNU sed, which has to be packaged as a hosttool then.

[ ] RSC:Invent a project_clean mechanism (workaround done)

[ ] RSC:is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??

[ ] sandeep: add a script to setup a new project interactively

[ ] RSC: do module stuff in kernel only when modules are enabled
    in kernel configuration

[ ] RSC: audit bash for configure/menu entry consistency

[ ] RSC: bing outputs strange large numbers when being compiled for ARM
    :-) Add test suite for floating point. 

[ ] RSC: port LTT-ng

[ ] RSC: Mozilla has still problems with cross compilation. See the
    following Bugzilla entries for possible solutions: 
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104541
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172651 

[ ] RSC: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
    size etc.).

[ ] RSC: fix busybox extract script to support "select CONFIG_foo"

[ ] RSC: make MTDutils release and, by the way, fix build process. 
    This "override" mechanism in the Makefile seems to be broken.
    MKL: mtdutils buildprocess fixed, splitted into 2 seperate file
    mtd.make and xchain-mtd.make 'override' seems to be working

[ ] RSC: audit all configure calls to be relative; configure scripts
    seem to have major problems when being called with absulute path

[ ] RSC: test flash

[ ] RSC: finish integration of iwconfig

[ ] RSC: add #ifdef __cplusplus ... #else ... #endif to bits/in.h

[ ] RSC: add .in file for xvkbd; integrate fixes for Makefile...

[ ] MKL: check openssl works with arm big endian (-DL_ENDIAN doesn't look good)

[ ] MKL: gmp3 cannot produce shared libc for ppc target (host i686-linux)

[ ] MKL: uclinux, patch breaks due to unclean produced patch at uclinux

[ ] MKL: test betaftp, old breaks due to a patch from DKE

[ ] MKL: test wxwindows

[ ] MKL: gawk fix prefix, due to hard coded path

[ ] MKL: integrate ldd (./build/glibc-2.2.5/elf/ldd.bash.in)

[ ] MKL: tweak wireless to xcompile

[ ] RSC: you currently need gdk-pixbuf-csource on the host       

[ ] RSC: pango has a patch which has to be verified (GLIB_CFLAGS)

[ ] RSC: you currently need libXcursor.so.* and xcursorgen on the
    development host

[ ] RSC: replace bootdisk build mechanism by genext2fs; mke2fs is able 
    to reserve N blocks at the beginning of the image!

[ ] KUB: busybox/ash job control is broken

[ ] RSC: add checksums for download 

[ ] RSC: restructure config file layout

[ ] RSC: add a test: if #!/bin/sh scripts return 
    "/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied"
    tell the user to look if his filesystem was monted 
    with the "exec" option

[ ] RSC: check for uImage targets: have to depend on vmlinux, not on
    zImage. 

[ ] LGR: concept for debug levels: strip, -g, -S 

[ ] LGR: key infrastructure: integrate signing, activate this only 
    when running the release cycle. 

[ ] BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as 
    fallback (e.g. mirrors)

[ ] BBU: rsync URLs

[ ] BBU: show required cross-tool, host-gcc and -glibc-versions (compilercheck)
