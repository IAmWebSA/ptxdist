Current TODO List
=================

- RSC: audit bash for configure/menu entry consistency
- RSC: maybe add something like http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html
- RSC: bing outputs strange large numbers when being compiled for ARM :-) 
- RSC: LTT needs gtk-devel on host side; test if gtk-config is available
       and print out nice warning if not. 
- RSC: wget seems to always return 0 as it's retval when being called
       with -r. This is bad as it breaks the error detection mechanism. 
- RSC: busybox is somehow rebuilt when you make rootclean & world
- RSC:	This todo is not very current... add "update todo" to the todo file :-) 
- RSC:	patches/$PACKET is not cleaned by make clean; this may be
	irritating. On the other hand locally thrown-in patches should
	_not_ be removed on clean. Find a solution. 
- RSC: add libsysfs: http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net
- RSC: add regression tests from crosstool
- RSC: look at Herbert Poetzl's cross test stuff: 
       20040224182505.GA25038@MAIL.13thfloor.at
- RSC: look at Linux Kernel Headers project:
       http://ep09.pld-linux.org/~mmazur/linux-libc-headers/
- RSC: Mozilla has still problems with cross compilation. See the
       following Bugzilla entries for possible solutions: 
       http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104541
       http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172651 
- RSC: add  MatrixSSL

High Priority
-------------

- RSC: invent magic to find out which tools are not installed on the 
       user's machine (currently we know tic, bison, yacc...)
- RSC: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
       size etc.).
- RSC: uClibc is removed at the moment: the "Extract" and regexp magic 
       doesn't seem to work properly. mkprefix makes wrong UCLIBC_ fixes 
       in Config.in and Config.in is not included at all. 
- RSC: use new config/innokom.ptxconfig vs. config/kernel/... scheme
       also for other platforms. 
- RSC: audit configurations: we now have the rules/vendor-tweaks
       mechanism instead of /data stuff and /etc copying. Add 
       copy mechanism to config specific tree if necessary... 
- RSC: fix busybox extract script to support "select CONFIG_foo"
- RSC: make MTDutils release and, by the way, fix build process. 
       This "override" mechanism in the Makefile seems to be broken.
       - MKL: mtdutils buildprocess fixed, splitted into 2 seperate file
              mtd.make and xchain-mtd.make
              'override' seems to be working
- RSC: audit all configure calls to be relative; configure scripts
       seem to have major problems when being called with absulute path
- RSC: test flash
- RSC: finish integration of iwconfig
- RSC: glibc does somehow not install _G_config.h when libio is not
       used, which breaks gcc-stage2. At least sometimes :-( This 
       effect is observed only on certain systems (all Debian unstable,
       but downgrading does not help). Has to be evaluated!!!
       - MKL: this _may_ be fixed by the new xchain building process in 
              the HEAD
- RSC: add #ifdef __cplusplus ... #else ... #endif to bits/in.h
- RSC: add .in file for xvkbd; integrate fixes for Makefile...
- RSC: busybox 1.00-pre2 has lots of problems (broken job control/
       controlling ttys, strange terminal effects etc.). This makes it 
       worse than the old 0.6x versions. We probably should make the 
       version configurable, but this needs the kconfig extraction 
       mechanism to be run at runtime. I don't have a good idea how 
       to do this yet.
- RSC: For the patches I would like to have a selection mechanism 
       in kconfig.
       - MKL: are you happy with _this_? :)
- RSC: Before release test: innokom, cameron and i386-generic-glibc 
- RSC: - patches/ 
       - src/*.diff, *.patch
       - etc/solidcard-bmwm-20030821-1/xmodmap
- MKL: produce TARGET_CFLAGS somewhere with quotes, so that it's save to use
       them w/o extra quoting....
- MKL: check openssl works with arm big endian (-DL_ENDIAN doesn't look good)
- MKL: gmp3 cannot produce shared libc for ppc target (host i686-linux)

Low Priority
------------
- MKL: uclinux, patch breaks due to unclean produced patch at uclinux
- MKL: test betaftp, old breaks due to a patch from DKE
- MKL: test qte, wxwindows
- MKL: teach qte to crosscompile
- MKL: autotoolize rn
- MKL: gawk fix prefix, due to hard coded path
- MKL: integrate ldd (./build/glibc-2.2.5/elf/ldd.bash.in)
- MKL: fix targetinstall *so* -> [-.]*so*
- MKL: include with wildcard ifeq style?
- MKL: tweak wireless to xcompile
- MKL: lilo, tinylogin targetinstall
- RSC: finish integration of zebra
- RSC: you currently need gdk-pixbuf-csource on the host       
- RSC: pango has a patch which has to be verified (GLIB_CFLAGS)
- RSC: you currently need libXcursor.so.* and xcursorgen on the
       development host
- RSC: replace bootdisk build mechanism by genext2fs; mke2fs is able 
       to reserve N blocks at the beginning of the image!
- RSC: audit configurations for local directory
- KUB: busybox/ash job control is broken
- RSC: audit for LSB compatiblity
- RSC: audit for FOODIR vs. FOO_DIR
- RSC: add checksums for download 
- RSC: have a look at http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ 
- RSC: install e2fsck
- RSC: create users 
- RSC: restructure config file layout
- RSC: add a test: if #!/bin/sh scripts return 
       "/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied"
       tell the user to look if his filesystem was monted 
       with the "exec" option
- JST: GPL version 2
- LGR: recompile x86 compilers recursively
- RSC: integrate big endian toolchain for ARM: 
- RSC: make bootdisk contents part of the nfsroot directory, but 
       let ptxflash not copy it to the target flash disk
- RSC: check if Dan Kegel's scripts can be integrated:
	- regression tests
       MKL: /me is working on this
- RSC: check for uImage targets: have to depend on vmlinux, not on
       zImage. 
- LGR: concept for debug levels: strip, -g, -S 
- LGR: Binary packets: system V package tools (cpio/pre/post)
- LGR: key infrastructure: integrate signing, activate this only 
       when running the release cycle. 
- BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as 
       fallback (e.g. mirrors)
- BBU: rsync URLs
