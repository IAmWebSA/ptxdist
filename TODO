Test suite components to be added
=================================

- RSC:	http://ltp.sourceforge.net/tooltable.php
- RSC:	Add more test suite stuff: 
	- http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html
	- http://www.plumhall.com/stec.html
- RSC:	lmbench
- RSC: 	add regression tests from crosstool
- RSC: 	look at Herbert Poetzl's cross test stuff: 
       	20040224182505.GA25038@MAIL.13thfloor.at
- RSC: 	look at Linux Kernel Headers project:
       	http://ep09.pld-linux.org/~mmazur/linux-libc-headers/
- RSC:  audit for LSB compatiblity
- RSC:  have a look at http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ 

Current TODO List
=================

- RSC:	in NATIVE=1 mode libpthread.so.0 is not copied; find out why
- RSC:	write back .config after make menuconfig (with oldconfig applied)
- RSC:	port XOrg 7.0
- MKL:	let get stages depend on the actual makefile
- RSC:	Finish autotoolisation of chrony. The old features from the 
	handwritten configure script have to be added; readline dependency
	is now temporarily fixed, it should be made optional again. 
- RSC:	sed: replace all "sed" occurences by $(SED) and maybe switch to 
	a newer GNU sed, which has to be packaged as a hosttool then. 
- RSC:	Invent a project_clean mechanism
- RSC:	is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??
- RSC:	check bash (doesn't compile according to Lisa Hsu)
- sandeep: add a script to setup a new project interactively
- RSC: 	do module stuff in kernel only when modules are enabled
       	in kernel configuration
- RSC: 	audit bash for configure/menu entry consistency
- RSC: 	bing outputs strange large numbers when being compiled for ARM :-) 
	Add test suite for floating point. 
- RSC: 	LTT needs gtk-devel on host side; test if gtk-config is available
       	and print out nice warning if not. 
- RSC: 	Mozilla has still problems with cross compilation. See the
       	following Bugzilla entries for possible solutions: 
       	http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104541
       	http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172651 
- RSC: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
       size etc.).
- RSC: fix busybox extract script to support "select CONFIG_foo"
- RSC: make MTDutils release and, by the way, fix build process. 
       This "override" mechanism in the Makefile seems to be broken.
  MKL: mtdutils buildprocess fixed, splitted into 2 seperate file
       mtd.make and xchain-mtd.make 'override' seems to be working
- RSC: audit all configure calls to be relative; configure scripts
       seem to have major problems when being called with absulute path
- RSC: test flash
- RSC: finish integration of iwconfig
- RSC: add #ifdef __cplusplus ... #else ... #endif to bits/in.h
- RSC: add .in file for xvkbd; integrate fixes for Makefile...
- MKL: check openssl works with arm big endian (-DL_ENDIAN doesn't look good)
- MKL: gmp3 cannot produce shared libc for ppc target (host i686-linux)
- MKL: uclinux, patch breaks due to unclean produced patch at uclinux
- MKL: test betaftp, old breaks due to a patch from DKE
- MKL: test qte, wxwindows
- MKL: teach qte to crosscompile
- MKL: gawk fix prefix, due to hard coded path
- MKL: integrate ldd (./build/glibc-2.2.5/elf/ldd.bash.in)
- MKL: tweak wireless to xcompile
- RSC: you currently need gdk-pixbuf-csource on the host       
- RSC: pango has a patch which has to be verified (GLIB_CFLAGS)
- RSC: you currently need libXcursor.so.* and xcursorgen on the
       development host
- RSC: replace bootdisk build mechanism by genext2fs; mke2fs is able 
       to reserve N blocks at the beginning of the image!
- KUB: busybox/ash job control is broken
- RSC: add checksums for download 
- RSC: restructure config file layout
- RSC: add a test: if #!/bin/sh scripts return 
       "/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied"
       tell the user to look if his filesystem was monted 
       with the "exec" option
- RSC: check for uImage targets: have to depend on vmlinux, not on
       zImage. 
- LGR: concept for debug levels: strip, -g, -S 
- LGR: key infrastructure: integrate signing, activate this only 
       when running the release cycle. 
- BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as 
       fallback (e.g. mirrors)
- BBU: rsync URLs
