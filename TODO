Current TODO List
=================

- RSC:	Move projects/generic/etc to config/etc
- JBE: For menu entries that enables additional entries when they are
	selected: Reorganize them to use a submenu instead the current
	menu. It looks nicer in "menuconfig" and its much better
	supported when using "xconfig"
- JBE: Sort program entries in "Shell & Console Tools" and other
	menus by function, not by program name! Especially if there is
	more than one program that can do the job (see menu entries
	"Apache 1", "Apache 2" and "thttpd").
	To be more concise the whole group should have a checkbox. Not
	until someone unlocks the "HTTP Server" group he can see the
	programs in this group.
- JBE:  For a graphical configurator instead of the ncurses one:
	Maybe ship a static linked "qconfig" version, otherwise the
	user also has to install the qt development libraries
	Same with ncurses (menuconfig), or the user has to be forced
	to install the development libraries for ncurses
- JBE:  Make target "qconfig" starts target "oldconfig", even if
	the configuration was aborted! Target "menuconfig" doesn't
- JBE:  add an identifier to a (central) toolchain (in "make setup").
	It should be possible to use more than one toolchain in a local
	ptxdist folder (for different targets/projects). So the idetifier
	selects the right toolchain for this project. This identifier
	simplifies the toolchain selection. There could be a central
	folder in the system with all informations (and identifiers)
	about any available toolchain installed on this system.
- JBE:  add documentation to start from scratch with "make setup"
	this menu should provide the toolchain, all pathes to everything
	(also to a prebuilt toochain). All other targets should be project
	specific.
- JBE:	fix Kconfig files in a way that only working combinations
	can be selected if experimental is not checked
- JBE:	separate between toolchains and project
- JBE:	more help texts
- RSC:	Test on SuSE 10.0: the following packets have to be installed:
	- ncurses-dev
	- bison
	- ipkg for the host needs python distutils
- RSC:	crosstool installs in build-target, not in build-cross
- RSC:	crosstool doesn't build with gcc-4.0.2
- RSC:	make projects doesn't find local_projects/something, if
	something is a softlink and not a directory.
- RSC:	replace perl by (modern) sed -i (hosttool)
- RSC:	Do ipkg stuff during make images
- RSC:	in NATIVE=1 mode libpthread.so.0 is not copied; find out why
- RSC:	write back .config after make menuconfig (with oldconfig applied)
- RSC:	port XOrg 7.0
- MKL:	let get stages depend on the actual makefile
- RSC:	Finish autotoolisation of chrony. The old features from the
	handwritten configure script have to be added; readline dependency
	is now temporarily fixed, it should be made optional again.
- RSC:	sed: replace all "sed" occurences by $(SED) and maybe switch to
	a newer GNU sed, which has to be packaged as a hosttool then.
- RSC:	Invent a project_clean mechanism
- RSC:	is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??
- RSC:	check bash (doesn't compile according to Lisa Hsu)
- sandeep: add a script to setup a new project interactively
- RSC: 	do module stuff in kernel only when modules are enabled
       	in kernel configuration
- RSC: 	audit bash for configure/menu entry consistency
- RSC: 	bing outputs strange large numbers when being compiled for ARM :-) 
	Add test suite for floating point. 
- RSC: 	LTT needs gtk-devel on host side; test if gtk-config is available
       	and print out nice warning if not. 
- RSC: 	Mozilla has still problems with cross compilation. See the
       	following Bugzilla entries for possible solutions: 
       	http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104541
       	http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172651 
- RSC: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
       size etc.).
- RSC: fix busybox extract script to support "select CONFIG_foo"
- RSC: make MTDutils release and, by the way, fix build process. 
       This "override" mechanism in the Makefile seems to be broken.
  MKL: mtdutils buildprocess fixed, splitted into 2 seperate file
       mtd.make and xchain-mtd.make 'override' seems to be working
- RSC: audit all configure calls to be relative; configure scripts
       seem to have major problems when being called with absulute path
- RSC: test flash
- RSC: finish integration of iwconfig
- RSC: add #ifdef __cplusplus ... #else ... #endif to bits/in.h
- RSC: add .in file for xvkbd; integrate fixes for Makefile...
- MKL: check openssl works with arm big endian (-DL_ENDIAN doesn't look good)
- MKL: gmp3 cannot produce shared libc for ppc target (host i686-linux)
- MKL: uclinux, patch breaks due to unclean produced patch at uclinux
- MKL: test betaftp, old breaks due to a patch from DKE
- MKL: test qte, wxwindows
- MKL: teach qte to crosscompile
- MKL: gawk fix prefix, due to hard coded path
- MKL: integrate ldd (./build/glibc-2.2.5/elf/ldd.bash.in)
- MKL: tweak wireless to xcompile
- RSC: you currently need gdk-pixbuf-csource on the host       
- RSC: pango has a patch which has to be verified (GLIB_CFLAGS)
- RSC: you currently need libXcursor.so.* and xcursorgen on the
       development host
- RSC: replace bootdisk build mechanism by genext2fs; mke2fs is able 
       to reserve N blocks at the beginning of the image!
- KUB: busybox/ash job control is broken
- RSC: add checksums for download 
- RSC: restructure config file layout
- RSC: add a test: if #!/bin/sh scripts return 
       "/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied"
       tell the user to look if his filesystem was monted 
       with the "exec" option
- RSC: check for uImage targets: have to depend on vmlinux, not on
       zImage. 
- LGR: concept for debug levels: strip, -g, -S 
- LGR: key infrastructure: integrate signing, activate this only 
       when running the release cycle. 
- BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as 
       fallback (e.g. mirrors)
- BBU: rsync URLs
