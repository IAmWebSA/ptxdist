PTXdist Documentation Fragments
-------------------------------

This file is meant as an intermediate place where we can collect
documentation sniplets; later this will be combined into a "real"
manual. 

Configuring the Kernel
----------------------

It is currently not possible to configure a 2.4 kernel with the config
system, because 2.4 is still based on the old CML language, not on
KConfig like 2.6 and PTXdist. There is a workaround: First you have to
set a path to a kernel configuration file (in: Kernel->Name of config in
$(PTXDIST)/config/kernel) to be used) to a config file; the kernel
config file doesn't need to exist. Choose the desired kernelversion,
then exit the menuconfig with save and 'make kernel_menuconfig' then the
kernel is downloaded, extracted patched and the normal menuconfig from
the kernel is started. PTXdist takes care of changes in the kernels
.config files, it's is copied from and to the specified config file.
