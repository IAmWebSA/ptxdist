This information should help to easily migrate projects from
any older ptxdist revisions to the current release.

Migrate a configuration from any other revision
 - open the ptxconfig file with your favorite editor and navigate to the
   variable definition PTXCONF_CONFIGFILE_VERSION
 - replace the revision definition by the current ptxdist revision you like to work
   with. You will get the current ptxdist revision be entering:
     $ ptxdist --version

Migrate a configuration from prior 0.10.1:
 To reuse a 0.10.0 configuration file two things have to change
 in this configuration file:
  - change/add the variable PTXCONF_CONFIGFILE_VERSION to this
    configuration file like described in migrate from any other
    revision.
  - replace any $(VARIABLE) (=parentheses) occurence by ${VARIABLE} (=curly brackets)

Migrate a configuration from prior 0.10.5:
 Kernel configuration variables names are changed. So every 0.10.4 project
 needs to be reconfigured, if user specific values are in use:
 - kernel version
 - kernel patch control file name
 - kernel configuration file name
 If the defaults are in use, no modification is required. A "ptxdist oldconfig" does
 the job.

You should examine carefully the resulting configuration. Due to variable name changes
or packet version updates the old configuration may fail or misses something.
