Release Process Specification for PTXdist	2005-08-08-1 RSC
-----------------------------------------

- Update all repositories to the latest versions (ptxdist,
  ptxdist-projects). 

- Run 'make config-test' to check if all configurations are consistent.
  If you have to answer questions, check if all defaults are sane, which
  means that programs which are not useful for most people are set to N
  by default.

- Check in all changes of the .ptxconfig files after reviewing the patch
  carefully. 

- Run the 'make toolchains' part, to check if all toolchains are being
  built correctly. Until now it is not possible to build into a custom
  directory, so move the old toolchain dir in /opt away (for example to
  -orig), recreate crosstool-x.y and donate it to the user running the
  test. Then start with 'make toolchains'.
