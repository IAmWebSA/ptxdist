	config BUILD_USERLAND
		bool
		prompt "Userland "
		help
		  Select this menu if you want to build your userland programs, e.g.
		  applications, shells etc. This requires a ready-to-use toolchain
		  (compiler, assembler, linker and the base runtime environment)

	config BUILD_TOOLCHAIN
		bool
		prompt "Toolchain"
		help
		  Select this menu if you want to build a toolchain and the base runtime
		  environment. This is the opposite of building "Userland". Building
		  userland application requires this step first.
