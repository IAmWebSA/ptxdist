	  Name of this project; each PTXdist "Project" specifies a unique 
	  configuration for an embedded Linux project. A project constists
	  of one directory in $(PROJECTDIR), which is usually to be found
	  in $(TOPDIR)/projects when being delivered with the PTXdist base
	  package. 

	  You can specifiy an additional directory which is being searched
	  for "local" projects with "make setup". The predefined path
	  for local projects is $(TOPDIR)/local_projects. 

	  To find out which projects are available in the current tree, 
	  type "make configs".
