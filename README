PTXdist
=======


Intro
-----

First of all: we need a new name for this project. PTXdist is just a
working title for our development baby. Please contact me if you have a
good idea. 


Idea
----

PTXdist is a tool which can be used to generate a root tree for all
kinds of Linux systems. It was written with embedded systems in mind,
but there is no reason why you can't use it to configure your firewall,
router or whatever dedicated "device" comes to your mind. 

The job works like this: you run 'make menuconfig' or 'make xconfig',
configure what you need and get a .config file. Run 'make world' and
you'll find a root tree in root/. Voila. 


Directory layout
----------------

bootdisk/	skeleton for bootdisk (if you need one)	
build/		Here all the packages are extracted and being built
config/		Configuration system, ext. configuration scripts
etc/		skeleton for /etc for the target system
local/		tools which are installed locally go to this dir
root/		root filesystem for the target
rules/		Makefiles for all packages
scripts/	several little helper scripts
src/		original sources and patches 
src_ptx/	local sources
state/		state files (show in which state packages currently are
		during the compilation)


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The installation takes it's configuration from two config files in the toplevel
directory: .config (for userland) and .kernelconfig (for the kernel). You can
either copy them to this location or, for the userland, enter "make menuconfig"
or "make xconfig" to generate a configuration. The kernel configuration is
currently not included in the global configuration system, so you have to
provide a .kernelconfig file manually.

When everything is configured just enter "make world" and wait... The resulting
root filesystem will be in the root/ directory.  


Bugs
----

- kernel: configuration is not yet included (kconfig vs. cml1 problem). 
  As long as we don't have a solution the kernel configuration is
  actually taken from .kernelconfig in the toplevel directory. 
- busybox: patch compiler config variable in configuration
- check if all tools use the correct compilers 
- search for FIXMEs
- before starting you should look at the .config file and fix PTXCONF_PREFIX 
  to point to a directory where you want the local stuff to be builded (like 
  cross compilers etc).
