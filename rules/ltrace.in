	  ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command
	  until it exits. While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and
	  records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed
	  process and the signals received by that process. It can also
	  intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.

	  The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
	  use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
