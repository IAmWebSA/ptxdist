	  zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
	  OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari and Macintosh, Amiga and Acorn RISC OS.

	  It is analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands tar(1) and com-
	  press(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS sys-
	  tems).
