	  The X Render Extension adds support for alpha-blended icons, anti-aliased
	  fonts and drawing primitives, as well as true-color animated mouse cursors
	  to the X window system.
	  This library is recommeded if you want to run terminals with anti-aliased
	  fonts. Without this library on the terminal (=server) side everything gets
	  rendered on the client side (=host), with a very bad perfomrmance.
