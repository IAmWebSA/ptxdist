	  Dotlockfile is a command line utility to safely create,
	  test and remove lockfiles. Lockfiles are created in an
	  NFS-safe way. Dotlockfile can can also be used to lock
	  and unlock mailboxes even if the mailspool directory
	  is only writable by group mail. However, its use is not
	  restricted to mail
