	  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements 
	  an Internet domain name server. BIND is the most 
	  widely-used name server software on the Internet, 
	  and is supported by the Internet Software Consortium.

	  Bind9 is a major rewrite, which is widely considered 
	  to be a lot more secure and stable than its buggy
	  predecessors bind4.x and bind8.x. It supports 
	  encryption, multiple views on your dns zones and
	  dynamic zone updates.
