	  fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create
	  and modify ZIP and ZIP64 archives based on libzip implemented
	  in C++.

	  With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real
	  directories. Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any
	  application without modifications.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2019.05.0
	  Old version that is no longer available for download.
	  Should be updated to a new version.
