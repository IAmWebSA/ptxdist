	  Xalf is a small utility to provide feedback when
	  starting X11 applications. Feedback can be given
	  via four different indicators: an invisible window
	  (to be used in conjunction with a task pager like
	  GNOME's tasklist_applet or KDE's Taskbar), an
	  generic splashscreen, an hourglass attached to the
	  mouse cursor, or an animated star.
