	  Libxml2 is a XML C parser and toolkit. XML itself is a
	  metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text
	  language where semantic and structure are added to the
	  content using extra "markup" information enclosed
	  between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known
	  markup language. Though the library is written in C a
	  variety of language bindings make it available in other
	  environments.

	help
	  Add the Catalog support.
	  What is a catalog? Basically it's a lookup mechanism used
	  when an entity (a file or a remote resource) references
	  another entity. The catalog lookup is inserted between
	  the moment the reference is recognized by the software
	  (XML parser, stylesheet processing, or even images
	  referenced for inclusion in a rendering) and the time
	  where loading that resource is actually started.
