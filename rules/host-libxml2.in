	  Libxml2 is a XML C parser and toolkit. XML itself is a
	  metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text
	  language where semantic and structure are added to the
	  content using extra "markup" information enclosed
	  between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known
	  markup language. Though the library is written in C a
	  variety of language bindings make it available in other
	  environments.
