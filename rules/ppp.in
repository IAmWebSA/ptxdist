	  Just like SLIP, PPP is a protocol to send
	  datagrams across a serial connection, but
	  addresses a couple of deficiencies of the
	  former. It lets the communicating sides
	  negotiate options such as the IP address
	  and the maximum datagram size at startup
	  time, and provides for client authorization.
