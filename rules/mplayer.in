	  The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux

 	  It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many
	  native and win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and
	  even DivX movies too. The other big feature of mplayer
	  is the wide range of supported output drivers.
	  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
	  but you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL)
	  and some lowlevel card-specific drivers
	  (for Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too.
