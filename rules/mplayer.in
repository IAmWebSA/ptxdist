	  The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux
 
 	  It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many 
	  native and win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and 
	  even DivX movies too. The other big feature of mplayer 
	  is the wide range of supported output drivers. 
	  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, 
	  but you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL) 
	  and some lowlevel card-specific drivers 
	  (for Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too.
