	  From the FAQ (refer http://tcl.sourceforge.net/faqs/):
	  Tcl and Tk originated with Dr. John Ousterhout while teaching at the
	  University of California, Berkeley, California.
	  [...]
	  Dr. Ousterhout got the idea for Tcl while on sabbatical leave at
	  DEC's Western Research Laboratory in the fall of 1987.  He started
	  actually implementing it when he got back to Berkeley in the spring
	  of 1988; by summer of that year it was in use in some internal
	  applications, but there was no Tk.  The first external releases of
	  Tcl were in 1989. Tk implemention began in 1989, and the first
	  release of Tk was in 1991. [...]
	  The current implementation uses a byte code interpreter and runtime
	  compilation.
