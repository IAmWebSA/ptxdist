	  Multiprecision arithmetic library
 
	  GNU MP is a programmer's library for arbitrary precision
	  arithmetic (ie, a bignum package).  It can operate on signed
	  integer, rational, and floating point numeric types.
	  
	  It has a rich set of functions, and the functions have 
	  a regular interface.
