	  libpcap is a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture.
	  libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring.
	  Applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring,
	  network debugging, etc.  Since almost every system vendor provides a
	  different interface for packet capture, and since we've developed
	  several tools that require this functionality, we've created this
	  system-independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for
	  several system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.

	  In order to run this library the kernel must support some features.
	  This note from the 2.6 kernel says:
	  CONFIG_PACKET:
	   The Packet protocol is used by applications which communicate directly
	   with network devices without an intermediate network protocol
	   implemented in the kernel, e.g. tcpdump. If you want them to work,
	   choose Y.

	  Enable this if you require ipv6 support.
