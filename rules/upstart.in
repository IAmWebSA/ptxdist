	  upstart is a replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which
	  handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping
	  them during shutdown and supervising them while the system
	  is running.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2015.02.0
	  This package has not been maintained in a long time. The build
	  system is broken. Compiling fails with newer toolchains. Upgrade
	  to recent release is required.
