	help

	  Enabling this opton causes the executables and libs to be
	  stripped with elfickers[1] sstrip instead of the standard
	  binutils strip command.

	  It should be noted that the resulting file cannot be used
	  with gdb, objdump, or any other program based upon the bfd
	  library, at all. In fact, the program will not even
	  recognize the file as a valid executable.

	  _Note_: enabling this options will cause your whole root
	  file system to be recompiled.
