	  MadWifi is one of the most advanced WLAN drivers
	  available for Linux today. It is stable and has
	  an established userbase. The driver itself is open
	  source but depends on the proprietary Hardware
	  Abstraction Layer (HAL) that is available in binary
	  form only.

	  Athstats takes two arguments, an interface to query
	  and an interval period (between successive queries)
	  in milliseconds. For e.g. /usr/bin/athstats-oml
	   --interface ath0 --interval 100 implies that this
	  application will query the interface ath0 every 100ms.
