	  These are the Linux scheduler utilities - schedutils for short. These programs
	  take advantage of the scheduler family of syscalls that Linux implements across
	  various kernels. These system calls implement interfaces for scheduler-related
	  parameters such as CPU affinity and real-time attributes. The standard UNIX
	  utilities do not provide support for these interfaces -- thus this package.

config SCHEDUTILS_CHRT
	bool
	prompt "chrt"
	help
	  chrt manipulates the real-time attributes of a process.

config SCHEDUTILS_IONICE

	  ionice gets/sets the program io scheduling class and priority.

config SCHEDUTILS_TASKSET
	bool
	prompt "taskset"
	help
	  taskset retrieves or sets a process's CPU affinity.
