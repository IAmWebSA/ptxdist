	  These are the Linux scheduler utilities - schedutils for short. These programs
	  take advantage of the scheduler family of syscalls that Linux implements across
	  various kernels. These system calls implement interfaces for scheduler-related
	  parameters such as CPU affinity and real-time attributes. The standard UNIX
	  utilities do not provide support for these interfaces -- thus this package.
