	  The Pek Window Manager is written by Claes Nästen, the code
	  is based on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved
	  enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all. It has a
	  much expanded feature-set, including window grouping
	  (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama,
	  keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.
