	  Clementine is a window manager for X, based on  aewm. 
	  Clementine is re-written in C++. This project aims to 
	  create a small, fast window manager with a minimum amount 
	  of extra features added in order to make it useable. 
	  
	  Note from http://clementine.sourceforge.net: 
	  
	  Clementine is only somewhat functional at the moment. 
	  Unless you plan to hack on the source, it is not recommended 
	  that you do much with it
