	  With mknbi you can create tagged images for Etherboot.
	  Tagged images are data files, which contain the
	  necessary files for booting up (kernel+root for
	  linux, kernel+minifs for dos, ...) bundled together
	  with a special format.

	  These tagged images are downloaded and understood
	  by Etherboot and Netboot during the boot process.
