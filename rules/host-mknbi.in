	  With mknbi you can create tagged images for Etherboot. 
	  Tagged images are data files, which contain the 
	  necessary files for booting up (kernel+root for 
	  linux, kernel+minifs for dos, ...) bundled together 
	  with a special format.
 	  
	  These tagged images are downloaded and understood 
	  by Etherboot and Netboot during the boot process.
