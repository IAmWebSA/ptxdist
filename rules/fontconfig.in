	  Fontconfig is a font configuration and 
	  customization library, which does not depend on 
	  the X Window System.  It is designed to locate
 	  fonts within the system and select them according 
	  to requirements specified by applications.
 	  
	  Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor 
	  does it impose a particular rasterization library 
	  on the application.  The X-specific library 'Xft' 
	  uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 	  rasterize fonts.
