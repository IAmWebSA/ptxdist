	  GNU Zebra is free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocols. 
	  It is released as part of the GNU Project, and it is distributed under 
	  the GNU General Public License. It supports BGP-4 protocol as described 
	  in RFC1771 (A Border Gateway Protocol 4) as well as RIPv1, RIPv2 and 
	  OSPFv2. 
	  
	  Unlike traditional, monolithic architectures and even the so-called 
	  "new modular architectures" that remove the burden of processing 
	  routing functions from the cpu and utilize special ASIC chips instead, 
	  Zebra software offers true modularity.

	  Zebra is unique in its design in that it has a process for each protocol.
