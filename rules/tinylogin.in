	  TinyLogin is a suite of tiny Unix utilities for
	  handling logging into, being authenticated by,
	  changing one's password for, and otherwise
	  maintaining users and groups on an embedded
	  system. It also provides shadow password support
	  to enhance system security. TinyLogin is, as the
	  name implies, very small, and makes an excellent
	  complement to BusyBox on an embedded system
	  (though it can of course be used without).
