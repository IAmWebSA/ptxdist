	depends on BUILD_USERLAND
	help
	  This feature contains a collection of programs that are linked against
	  klibc. These duplicate some of the functionality of a regular Linux
	  toolset, but are typically much smaller than their full-function
	  counterparts. They are intended for inclusion in initramfs images and
	  can do the network configuration outside the kernel and someting
	  special before mounting the final root filesystem.
	  This will create a control file only at
	     ${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/build-target/$(KLIBC_DIR)/initramfs_spec
	  The real initramfs will be built by the kernel itself from this control
	  file. So in order to use this feature you have to enter this control
	  filename into the kernel feature -> initramfs entry field.
	  When you enter the name as showing above you will be path and
	  version independend.
