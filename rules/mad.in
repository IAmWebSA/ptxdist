	  MAD is an MPEG audio decoder.

	  It currently only supports the MPEG 1 standard, but fully
	  implements all three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II,
	  and Layer III, the latter often colloquially known as MP3).

	  There is also full support for ID3 tags.

	  All work is done in fixed point, so it even works on
	  machines without an FPU.
