	  Utilities for configuring the Linux ethernet bridge
 
	  This package contains utilities for configuring the 
	  Linux ethernet bridge in Linux 2.4 or later. 
	  
	  The Linux ethernet bridge can be used to tie multiple 
	  ethernet devices together. The connection is fully 
	  transparent: hosts connected to one ethernet device 
	  can see all hosts connected to any of the other 
	  ethernet devices directly.
