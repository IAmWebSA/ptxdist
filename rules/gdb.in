		  Termcap is a library of C functions that
		  enable programs to send control strings
		  to terminals in a way independent of the
		  terminal type.

		help
	  	  Use ncurses as terminal library.

		  The ncurses (new curses) library is a free
		  software emulation of curses. It uses terminfo
		  format, supports pads and color and multiple
		  highlights and forms charcters and function-key
		  mapping.
