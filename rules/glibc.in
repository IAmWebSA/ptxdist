menuconfig GLIBC
	bool
	default y
	prompt glibc
	help
	  This menu entry lets you select components from the standard
	  C library called glibc. It depends on the system what components are
	  required.

config GLIBC_VERSION
	prompt "glibc Version"
	string
	default "2.3.6"
	depends on GLIBC

comment	"Install options"
	depends on GLIBC

config GLIBC_LIBC
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	default y
	prompt "Install libc on the target"
	help
	  Any Unix-like operating system needs a C library:
	  the library which defines the "system calls" and
	  other basic facilities such as open, malloc, printf,
	  exit...

	  The GNU C library is used as the C library in the
	  GNU system and most systems with the Linux kernel.

	  Better not turn this option off..

config GLIBC_PTHREAD
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libpthread on the target"
	help
	  If at least one application on the target uses threads when executed
	  this library will be required.

config GLIBC_THREAD_DB
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libthread_db on the target"
	help
	  If at least one application on the target uses threads when executed
	  and you are going to debug this application (also remotely!), this
	  library will be required. You can omit this library, if you never
	  intend to debug multithread application on your target.

config GLIBC_LIBRT
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install librt on the target"
	help
	  Functions in this library provide most of the interfaces specified by
	  the POSIX.1b Realtime Extension

config GLIBC_DL
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libdl on the target"
	help
	  libdl.so is a dynamic linking library that is generally of use only for
	  porting applications. If you are porting a BeOS application that requires
	  dlopen, dlclose, dlerror, dlsym, dladdr, or dlfcn.h, then you can use this
	  library.

	  libdl.so is a wrapper to the add-on functions with the semantics of the dl
	  (dynamic linking) library. This is used for finding shared objects at run
	  time. If the items are not found the program can continue to run.

	  It is extremely similar to the add-on mechanism in BeOS with some semantics
	  changes. If you are developing your own app, you almost definitely want to
	  use add-ons unless you are already familiar with libdl. In this case you may
	  be disappointed since it is possible that I have implemented part of it wrong.

	  If you want your application to have cross platform compatibility with this
	  functionality you should probably use libtool instead. It is much more cross
	  platform compatible than dlopen, etc. It also supports BeOS. See related links.

config GLIBC_CRYPT
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libcrypt on the target"
	help
	  The encryption/decryption library

config GLIBC_UTIL
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libutil on the target"
	help
	  Contains code for "standard" functions used in many different Unix
	  utilities.

config GLIBC_LIBM
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libm on the target"
	help
	  If at least one application on your target does any kind of math
	  calculation, you should install this library.

config GLIBC_NSS_DNS
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_dns"
	select GLIBC_RESOLV
	help
	  Contains functions for name resolution to ip addresses and vice versa

config GLIBC_NSS_FILES
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_files"
	help
	  Contains functions to access some vitale system control files (for
	  login for example)

config GLIBC_NSS_HESIOD
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_hesiod"
	select GLIBC_RESOLV
	select GLIBC_NSS_FILES
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config GLIBC_NSS_NIS
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_nis"
	select GLIBC_NSL
	select GLIBC_NSS_FILES
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config GLIBC_NSS_NISPLUS
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_nisplus"
	select GLIBC_NSL
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config GLIBC_NSS_COMPAT
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnss_compat"
	select GLIBC_NSL
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config GLIBC_RESOLV
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libresolv"
	help
	  This library is required for creating, sending, and interpreting
	  packets to and from the internet domain name service. This library
	  needs some file for configuration: /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/resolv.conf.
	  Refer man pages for both files and how to setup them. To use any kind
	  of DNS, you must provide your own /etc/nsswitch.conf and
	  /etc/resolv.conf files. See menu "Root Filesystem -> config files -> /etc/nsswitch.conf"

config GLIBC_NSL
	bool
	depends on GLIBC
	prompt "Install libnsl"
	help
	  Functions in this library provide routines that provide a
	  transport-level interface to networking services like i.E.
	  nis(+)

config GLIBC_I18N_BIN_LOCALE
	bool
	prompt "Install locale"
	depends on GLIBC
	help
	  The locale program writes information about the current
	  locale environment, or all locales, to standard output.

config GLIBC_I18N_BIN_LOCALEDEF
	bool
	prompt "Install localedef"
	depends on GLIBC
	help
	  The  localedef  program reads the indicated charmap and
	  input files, compiles them to a binary form quickly usable
	  by the locale functions in the C library, and add it to
	  /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive

config GLIBC_I18N_RAWDATA
	bool
	prompt "Install i18n locales and charmaps"
	depends on GLIBC_I18N_BIN_LOCALEDEF
	help
	  With the i18n datasets you can generate new locales in running
	  system. This will, however, increase the installation size
	  unneccessarily if you don't want to change your system locale
	  often. Hence we recommend to use the "System locale" option in
	  ptxdist to determine locales while building the system.

menu "Install gconv libraries"
	depends on GLIBC

config GLIBC_GCONV_DEF
	bool
	prompt "  default gconv modules"
	depends on GLIBC
	default y
	help
	  install the iso8859-1 (Latin Alphabet No.1) and the iso8859-15 (Latin
	  Alphabet No.9) encoding modules into gconv, this should be ok for most
	  western languages

config GLIBC_GCONV_ZH
	bool
	prompt "  gconv modules for chinese language"
	depends on GLIBC
	help
	  install the gconv modules for chinese language, including BIG5, GB2312
	  and GB18030
