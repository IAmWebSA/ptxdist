	  FAM (File Alteration Monitor) is a server which tracks changes to the
	  filesystem and relays these changes to interested applications. Its
	  efficiency comes from consolidating the polling for all applications
	  or, with kernel support, from obtaining kernel notifications of file
	  system changes. This also works for network filesystems, if the remote
	  host also runs a fam daemon.

	  This version is patched so it uses kernel's DNOTIFY feature. Ensure this
	  feature is enabled in the kernel (search for symbol CONFIG_DNOTIFY)

	  This daemon requires portmap to spread its service.

	  This installs fam distribution's fam.conf file. Its almost generic and
	  usable.

config FAM_INETD_SERVER
	bool
	default y
	depends on FAM
	prompt "Start from inetd"
	help
	  This installs a startup configuration for famd from inetd. It adds to
	  the /etc/inetd.conf a line like this:
	   sgi_fam/1-2 stream  rpc/tcp wait root /usr/sbin/famd famd -c /etc/fam.conf
	  Note: You must enable one of the two possible inet daemons: There is
	  one embedded in busybox and one in packet inetutils.

config FAM_INETD_STRING
	string
	depends on FAM
	depends on FAM_INETD_SERVER
	prompt "inetd service entry"
	default "sgi_fam/1-2 stream  rpc/tcp wait root /usr/sbin/famd famd -c /etc/fam.conf"
	help
	  This string is added to inetd's configuration /etc/inetd.conf.
