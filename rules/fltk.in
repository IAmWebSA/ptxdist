	  fluid is an interactive GUI designer for FLTK and is needed to build
	  some of the demos.

	  When cross compiling FLTK fluid is built for the target platform.
	  Thus it will most probably not run on your host and compiling the 
	  demo programs will fail.

	  So you're better off leaving this disabled.
