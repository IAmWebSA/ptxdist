	  This is the DHCP server from version 3 of the Internet Software
	  Consortium DHCP package. For more information visit the ISC web
 	  site at http://www.isc.org/.

	  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like
	  BOOTP (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of
	  BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients based on lease
	  times.

 	  Multiple Ethernet Interfaces are supported by this DHCP package.
