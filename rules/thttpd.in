	  thttpd (thin httpd) is a small, fast secure webserver. 
	  
	  It features CGI support, URL-traffic-based throttling 
	  and basic authentication. thttpd has a very small memory 
	  footprint as it only forks itself in order to execute 
	  CGI scripts. It is designed to be as fast as fully 
	  featured web-servers and it performs extremely well 
	  under high load.
