	  thttpd (thin httpd) is a small, fast secure webserver.

	  It features CGI support, URL-traffic-based throttling
	  and basic authentication. thttpd has a very small memory
	  footprint as it only forks itself in order to execute
	  CGI scripts. It is designed to be as fast as fully
	  featured web-servers and it performs extremely well
	  under high load.
