		This driver is probably not real-time safe! Under certain conditions
		it can cause interrupt locks of up to 1 second (issue_and_wait). We
		need a rewrite of critical parts, but we are lacking the knowledge
		about the hardware details (e.g. how long does a normal delay take =>
		apply this value and throw an error message on timeouts).
