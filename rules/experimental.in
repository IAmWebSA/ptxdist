config EXP
	bool "Support experimental Stuff"
	help
	  Some options in PTXdist are considered to be experimental. 
	  Well, if I tell you the truth, *all* options are experimental, 
	  but the ones marked with PTXCONF_EXP are *officially* being
	  marked as experimental. 

config EXP_M
	bool "Support even more experimental Stuff"
	depends on EXP
	help
	  If you thought that PTXCONF_EXP was stuff you shouldn't try,
	  packets being marked with PTXCONF_EXP_M is definitely not for
	  people who do not want to live on the bleeding edge.
