config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Support experimental Stuff"
	help
	  Some options in PTXdist are considered to be experimental. 
	  Well, if I tell you the truth, *all* options are experimental, 
	  but the ones marked with PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL are *officially* 
	  being marked as experimental. 

config EXPERIMENTAL_MORE
	bool "Support even more experimental Stuff"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you thought that PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL was stuff you shouldn't 
	  try, packets being marked with PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL_MORE is 
	  definitely not for people who do not want to live on the 
	  bleeding edge.
