config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Support experimental Stuff"
	help
	  Some options in PTXdist are considered to be experimental. 
	  Well, if I tell you the truth, *all* options are experimental, 
	  but the ones marked with PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL are *officially* 
	  being marked as experimental. 

config EXPERIMENTAL_MORE
	bool "Support even more experimental Stuff"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you thought that PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL was stuff you shouldn't 
	  try, packets being marked with PTXCONF_EXPERIMENTAL_MORE is 
	  definitely not for people who do not want to live on the 
	  bleeding edge. 

config BROKEN
	bool "Support packets known to be broken"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If this option is checked, even packets are activated which
	  are known to be broken.
