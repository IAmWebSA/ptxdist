	  A command-line driven interactive plotting program for 
	  making 2D and 3D graphs from data and functions. 
	  
	  Supports lots of output formats, including drivers for 
	  many printers, (La)TeX, (x)fig, Postscript, and so on. 

	  Data files and self-defined functions can be manipulated by internal
 	  C-like language.  Can perform smoothing, spline-fitting, or nonlinear
 	  fits. Can work with complex numbers.
