		ntpclient is a small and efficient client to the NTP protocol.

		Description by Larry Doolittle:
		ntpclient is an NTP (RFC-1305) client for unix-alike computers. 
	       	Its functionality is a small subset of xntpd, but IMHO performs 
		better (or at least has the potential to function better) within 
		that limited scope. Since it is much smaller than xntpd, it is 
		also more relevant for embedded computers.
