	  cfgsh, the Configuration Shell utility, is a small utility
	  meant to be used for he configuration of embedded systems.
	  The idea is that for embedded systems the 'normal' way of
	  configuring a GNU/Linux host is simply non sentient - the
	  entire notion of an administrator that edits the system startup
	  scripts simply does not fit the an embedded device that by
	  definition is supposed to function with little or no
	  knowledgeable person intervention.

	  cfgsh is meant to replace the normal combination of utilities
	  such ifconfig, route and friends, together with the startup
	  scripts and configuration files that use them with a single
	  program and configuration file that will implement the same
	  functionality in a manner more consistent with the embedded
	  system world.
