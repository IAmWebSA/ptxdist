	  The GNU Bourne Again SHell
	  Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 	  commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 	  incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 	  
	  Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 	  IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
 	  
	  Included in the bash package is the Programmable Completion Code, 
	  by Ian Macdonald.

	  set  and unset with the alias and unalias builtin commands

	  that is similar to the history expansion in csh.

config BASH_BRACE
	bool
	prompt "Include brace expansion"
	depends on BASH
	help

	  to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated
          need not exist.

	   display is on a single line with directory 
	   names separated by spaces.  Directories are 
	   added to the list with the pushd command; 
	   the popd command removes entries from the list.
