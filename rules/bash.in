	  The GNU Bourne Again SHell
	  Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 	  commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 	  incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 	  
	  Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 	  IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
 	  
	  Included in the bash package is the Programmable Completion Code, 
	  by Ian Macdonald.
