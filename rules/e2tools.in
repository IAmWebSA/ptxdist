	help
	  E2tools is a simple set of GPL'ed utilities to read, write, 
	  and manipulate files in an ext2/ext3 filesystem. These 
	  utilities access a filesystem directly using the ext2fs 
	  library. I wrote these tools in order to copy files into 
	  linux filesystem on a machine that does not have ext2 
	  support. Of course, they can also be used on a linux 
	  machine to read/write to disk images or floppies without 
	  having to mount them or have root access.

	  The following functions have been implemented and have been 
	  tested on Linux (not extensively though):

    	  * copy files: e2cp
    	  * move files: e2mv
    	  * remove files: e2rm
    	  * create directory: e2mkdir
    	  * create hard links: e2ln
    	  * list files/directories: e2ls
    	  * output the last part of a file: e2tail
