	  These files are required to setup various keyboard mappings.
	  The tool xkbcomp on the target needs these files, to configure
	  the keyboard.
	  Note: This package needs xkbcomp also on your host to build some of
	  these files!
	  Use --datadir= to configure the target directory. Everything gets
	  installed into $(datadir)/X11/xkb
