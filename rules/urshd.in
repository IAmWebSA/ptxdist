	  urshd (micro remote shell server) is a server for rsh program.
	  It is (indirectly) derived from BSD rshd with all the security
	  checks cut off.  Unlike other versions it is standalone server
	  that does not depend on the inetd daemon.
	  BIT FAT WARNING:
	  URSH is a very huge security hole in your system as it grants
	  permission to everyone.

	  Enable this entry to install a startup script into
	  /etc/init.d. If no local 'projectroot/etc/init.d/urshd' exists, a
	  generic start script will be used.

	help
	  Enter the name of the urshd start link in /etc/init.d; this should
	  be something like "S12_urshd". An empty string means that no link
	  is created.
