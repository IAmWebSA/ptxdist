	  The Konqueror/Embedded project attempts to build up a special
	  version of the web browsing component of the KDE browser
	  Konqueror (in particular its html rendering engine khtml and
	  its io subsystem). Konqueror/Embedded runs on the Qt/Embedded
	  platform for embedded devices, in an environment without a KDE
	  installation or a X windowing system, as one static binary,
	  being as small as possible while still providing all essential
	  features of a web browser.
