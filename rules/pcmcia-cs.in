menuconfig PCMCIA_TOOLS
	bool "PCMCIA Tools        "
	depends on KERNEL_2_4
	help
	  The Linux pcmcia-cs package is officially deprecated.
	  It can only be used with 2.4 and older kernels. Current
	  information on PCMCIA support for recent 2.6 kernels is
	  available here.

	  Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.
	  It includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement a
	  version of the PCMCIA 2.1 Card Services applications program
	  interface, a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a
	  card manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and
	  removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand. It
	  supports "hot swapping" of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be
	  inserted and ejected at any time.
