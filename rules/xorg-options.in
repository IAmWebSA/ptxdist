config XORG_SMALL_TERMINAL
	bool
	prompt "A tiny terminal X"
	help
	  Select this if you want an X environment for small terminals only.
	  This server type does only the presentation of data, the clients are
	  running on other machines.
	  It does not support 3D features, and if the X extensions are enabled
	  there is no need for any local font rendering, nor for local fonts.

config XORG_FULL_BLOWN
	bool
	prompt "A full blown X"
	help
	  Select this type if you want to run a full blown X server on a
	  powerful target. For this type of target the X server and the X
	  clients are running on the same machine. This type supports 3D
	  features, but needs all the nice libraries to fontrendering, TTF
	  support, fonts et all.

config XORG_KEYBOARD_MAPPING_SUPPORT
	bool
	prompt "Support keyboard mappings"
	default n
	select XORG_DRIVER_INPUT_KEYBOARD
	select XORG_APP_XKBCOMP
	help
	  If you like to use a keyboard with your X server (mostly wanted)
	  enable this entry. Its required when you want to configure specific
	  keyboard layouts and key settings. Mostly needed on non-US keyboards.
	  Note: A german keyboard does not support the '@¤\[]{}|' keys when
	  disabled!

config XORG_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR
	string
	prompt "Default location for X' data files"
	default "/usr/share"
	help
	  Define here the default path, where X searches for its data files
	  (fonts, configurations, keyboard mappings, etc.). X adds an "X11"
	  postfix to this path. So /usr/share as a default path will result in
	  /usr/share/X11 with additional subdirectories for all the data files.

config XORG_OPTIONS_TRANS_UNIX
	bool
	prompt "UNIX domain socket transport"
	default y

	help
	  UNIX domain socket transport

config XORG_OPTIONS_TRANS_TCP
	bool
	prompt "TCP socket transport"

	help
	 TCP socket transport

config XORG_OPTIONS_TRANS_IPV6
	bool
	prompt "IPv6 support"
	default n
	depends on XORG_LIB_ICE
	help
	  Enable this if your X server needs IPv6 support. If the starting X
	  server complains about missing IPv6 support you should disable this
	  feature here due to the target environment does not support it (its
	  useless in this case)

config XORG_SERVER_OPT_SECURE_RPC
	bool
	prompt "secure RPC"
	default n
	help
	  FIXME

config XORG_SERVER_EXT_DRI
	bool
	prompt "Support for DRI"
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure to get 3D
	  accelerations support. This is meaningless if you do not have DRI
	  support in your kernel for you hardware.
	  Currently the build scripts needs DRI disabled when crosscompiling.
