	  The STL option will make it possible for you to use STL
	  code in your Qt code. In addition the Qt template
	  classes will support APIs that make it easy to convert
	  from and to STL types.
	  If you want to use stl in a non Qt sentence, then you
	  don't need to enable this option, but it would be wise
	  to do CONFIG+=stl in your .profile as this turns it on
	  in the compiler if necessary. Visual C++ needs stl to
	  be turned on in your .pro file for example, otherwise
	  it will issue a lot of warnings that mention the -GX
	  option.
