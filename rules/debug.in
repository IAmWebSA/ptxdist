	  In  the  simplest  case  strace  runs  the  specified  
	  command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the 
	  system calls which are called by a process and the 
	  signals which are received by a process.  The name of 
	  each system call, its arguments and its return value 
	  are printed on standard error
