	  FLEX is a tool for generating scanners: programs which
	  recognized lexical patterns in text. flex reads the given
	  input files for a description of a scanner to generate.
	  The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions
	  and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
	  file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().

	  This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl library to
	  produce an executable. When the executable is run, it
	  analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
	  expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the
	  corresponding C code.
