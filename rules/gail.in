	  GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library

	  Gail implements ATK interfaces for GTK+ widgets
	  which are dynamically loadable at runtime by a
	  GTK+ application. Once loaded, those parts of
 	  an application that use standard GTK+ widgets
	  will have a basic level of accessibility,
	  without the need to modify the application at all.
