	  GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library
	  
	  Gail implements ATK interfaces for GTK+ widgets 
	  which are dynamically loadable at runtime by a 
	  GTK+ application. Once loaded, those parts of
 	  an application that use standard GTK+ widgets 
	  will have a basic level of accessibility, 
	  without the need to modify the application at all.
