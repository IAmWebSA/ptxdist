	  systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV
	  and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
	  capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
	  offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
	  Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
	  maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
	  transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a
	  drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
