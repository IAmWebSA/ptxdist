	  popt command line argument parser library

	  popt is a command line option parsing library inspired
	  by the usefulness of getopt, but also by it's deficiencies.
	  Amongst other things, it doesn't use global variables,
	  can parse any argv-style array, option aliasing and
	  automatic generation of help and usage messages.
