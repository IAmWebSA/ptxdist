config UDEV

config UDEV_UDEV
	bool "udev"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udev provides a dynamic device directory containing only 
	  the files for actually present devices. It creates or 
	  removes device node files in the /dev directory, or it 
	  renames network interfaces.

       	  Usually udev runs as udevd(8) and receives uevents directly 
	  from the kernel if a device is added or removed form the system.

       	  If udev receives a device event, it matches its configured 
	  rules against the available device attributes provided in 
	  sysfs to identify the device. Rules that match, may provide 
	  additional device information or specify a device node name 
	  and multiple symlink names and instruct udev to run 
	  additional programs as part of the device event handling.

config UDEV_UDEVD
	bool "udevd"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevd listens to kernel uevents and passes the incoming 
	  events to udev. It ensures the right event order and 
	  takes care, that events for child devices are delayed 
	  until the parent has finished the device handling.

config UDEV_INFO
	bool "udevinfo"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevinfo queries the udev database for device 
	  information stored in the udev database. It 
	  can also query the properties of a device from 
	  its sysfs representation to help creating udev 
	  rules that match this device.

config UDEV_SEND
	bool "udevsend"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  This is the command the kernel calls if a hotplug event
	  occures (see /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug) to trigger the udev
	  subsystem.

config UDEV_START
	bool "udevstart"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config UDEV_TEST
	bool "udevtest"
	depends on UDEV
	help
	  udevtest simulates a udev run for the given device 
	  and prints out the name of the node udev would have 
	  created, or the name of the network interface, that
	  would have been renamend.

config UDEV_FW_HELPER
	bool "firmware helper"
	depends on UDEV
