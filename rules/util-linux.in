	  clock ticks, the second is the name of the C function
	  in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the
	  third is the normalized  `load' of the procedure, calculated
	  as a ratio between the number of ticks and the length of the
	  procedure. The output is filled with blanks to ease readability.
