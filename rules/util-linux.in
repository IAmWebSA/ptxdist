	  clock ticks, the second is the name of the C function 
	  in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the 
	  third is the normalized  `load' of the procedure, calculated 
	  as a ratio between the number of ticks and the length of the 
	  procedure. The output is filled with blanks to ease readability.
