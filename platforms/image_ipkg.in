config IMAGE_IPKG_PUSH_TO_REPOSITORY
	bool
	prompt "make images: push packets to ipkg-repository"
	help
	  If this option is checked the packet files are pushed to
	  the ipkg-repository (to be specified in .ptxdistrc).
	  
	  Please note, that the ipkg-repository is currently a
	  local directory on your machine.  

config IMAGE_IPKG_FORCED_PUSH
	depends on IMAGE_IPKG_PUSH_TO_REPOSITORY
	bool
	prompt "force ipkg-push"
	help
	  Usually the script checks for some previous ipkg-push to
	  a 'dist' release and requires you to delete a previous
	  dist directory
	  
	  If this option is checked, this is done by default. This
	  is most useful for development purposes.

config IMAGE_INSTALL_FROM_IPKG_REPOSITORY
	bool
	select IMAGE_IPKG_PUSH_TO_REPOSITORY
	select IMAGE_IPKG_FORCED_PUSH
	prompt "make images: install packets from ipkg-repository"
	help
	  If this option is checked the packet files from the
	  ipkg-repository are used to create the images
	  
	  Please note, that the ipkg-repository is currently a
	  local directory on your machine.

config IMAGE_IPKG_INDEX
	bool "generate ipkg.index"
	default y
	help
	  Activating this option generates a ipkg index file
	  ("Packages") in your PKGDIR. If served by a web or ftp
	  server it allows ipkg on your target to access your ipkg and
	  install or update them.

config IMAGE_IPKG_EXTRA_ARGS
	string
	default ""
	prompt "extra arguments passed to ipkg-build"
	help
	  If needed you can add extra arguments for ipkg-build here
	  (e.g. -c if you want ipkg-build to use tar instead of ar.)
